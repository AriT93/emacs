#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration files. It provides a tailored Emacs environment with customizations for various modes, themes, and settings. Key features include:

- Enhanced user interface with a custom theme
- Streamlined workflow with optimized keybindings
- Improved support for Org mode and other major modes

To use this configuration:

1.  Clone the repository to `~/.emacs.d`.
2.  Create a symbolic link to your init file (e.g., `init.el` or `init.org`).
3.  Start Emacs.
