;;; Commentary:

;; If you are working with XML documents, the parsed data structure
;; returned by the XML parser (xml.el) may be enough for you: Lists of
;; lists, symbols, strings, plus a number of accessor functions.
;;
;; If you want a more elaborate data structure to work with your XML
;; document, you can create a document object model (DOM) from the XML
;; data structure using dom.el.
;;
;; You can create a DOM from XML using `dom-make-document-from-xml'.
;; Note that `xml-parse-file' will return a list of top level elements
;; found in the file, so you must choose one element in that list.
;; Here's an example:
;;
;; (setq doc (dom-make-document-from-xml (car (xml-parse-file "sample.xml"))))
;;
;; Note that this DOM implementation uses the attributes and tag names
;; used by the XML parser.  If the XML parser uses symbols instead of
;; string (like xml.el does), then dom.el will also use symbols.  If the
;; XML parsers uses strings (like xml-parse.el does), then dom.el will
;; use strings.
;;
;; It should be trivial to write functions analogous to the
;; dom-*-from-xml functions in order to use an another XML parsers (from
;; psgml.el, for example).

;;; On Interfaces and Classes

;; The elisp DOM implementation uses the dom-node structure to store all
;; attributes.  The various interfaces consist of sets of functions to
;; manipulate these dom-nodes.  The functions of a certain interface
;; share the same prefix.

;;; Test:

;; The test code assumes a file named sample.xml with the following
;; content:

;;; Exception DOMException

;; DOM operations only raise exceptions in "exceptional" circumstances,
;; i.e., when an operation is impossible to perform (either for logical
;; reasons, because data is lost, or because the implementation has
;; become unstable). In general, DOM methods return specific error
;; values in ordinary processing situations, such as out-of-bound errors
;; when using NodeList.

;; Implementations should raise other exceptions under other
;; circumstances. For example, implementations should raise an
;; implementation-dependent exception if a null argument is passed.

;; Some languages and object systems do not support the concept of
;; exceptions. For such systems, error conditions may be indicated using
;; native error reporting mechanisms. For some bindings, for example,
;; methods may return error codes similar to those listed in the
;; corresponding method descriptions.

;;; Interface Document

;; The Document interface represents the entire HTML or XML document.
;; Conceptually, it is the root of the document tree, and provides the
;; primary access to the document's data.

;; Since elements, text nodes, comments, processing instructions, etc.
;; cannot exist outside the context of a Document, the Document interface
;; also contains the factory methods needed to create these objects. The
;; Node objects created have a ownerDocument attribute which associates
;; them with the Document within whose context they were created.

;; Creates an Attr of the given name. Note that the Attr instance can
;; then be set on an Element using the setAttributeNode method.

;;; Interface Node

;; The Node interface is the primary datatype for the entire Document
;; Object Model. It represents a single node in the document tree. While
;; all objects implementing the Node interface expose methods for dealing
;; with children, not all objects implementing the Node interface may have
;; children. For example, Text nodes may not have children, and adding
;; children to such nodes results in a DOMException being raised.

;; The attributes name, value and attributes are included as a mechanism
;; to get at node information without casting down to the specific
;; derived interface. In cases where there is no obvious mapping of
;; these attributes for a specific type (e.g., value for an Element or
;; attributes for a Comment), this returns null. Note that the
;; specialized interfaces may contain additional and more convenient
;; mechanisms to get and set the relevant information.

;; actually child nodes of the element they describe, the DOM does not
;; consider them part of the document tree. Thus, the Node attributes
;; parentNode, previousSibling, and nextSibling have a null value for Attr
;; objects. The DOM takes the view that attributes are properties of
;; elements rather than having a separate identity from the elements they
;; are associated with; this should make it more efficient to implement
;; such features as default attributes associated with all elements of a
;; given type. Furthermore, Attr nodes may not be immediate children of a
;; DocumentFragment. However, they can be associated with Element nodes
;; contained within a DocumentFragment. In short, users and implementors
;; of the DOM need to be aware that Attr nodes have some things in common
;; with other objects inheriting the Node interface, but they also are
;; quite distinct.

;; The attribute's effective value is determined as follows: if this
;; attribute has been explicitly assigned any value, that value is the
;; attribute's effective value; otherwise, if there is a declaration for
;; this attribute, and that declaration includes a default value, then
;; that default value is the attribute's effective value; otherwise, the
;; attribute does not exist on this element in the structure model until
;; it has been explicitly added. Note that the nodeValue attribute on the
;; Attr instance can also be used to retrieve the string version of the
;; attribute's value(s).

;; In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain entity references,
;; the child nodes of the Attr node may be either Text or EntityReference
;; nodes (when these are in use; see the description of EntityReference
;; for discussion). Because the DOM Core is not aware of attribute types,
;; it treats all attribute values as simple strings, even if the DTD or
;; schema declares them as having tokenized types.

;; ownerElement of type Element, readonly, introduced in DOM Level 2

;; The Element node this attribute is attached to or null if
;; this attribute is not in use.

;; Interface Element

;; The Element interface represents an element in an HTML or XML
;; document.  Elements may have attributes associated with them; since
;; the Element interface inherits from Node, the generic Node interface
;; attribute attributes may be used to retrieve the set of all
;; attributes for an element. There are methods on the Element interface
;; to retrieve either an Attr object by name or an attribute value by
;; name. In XML, where an attribute value may contain entity references,
;; an Attr object should be retrieved to examine the possibly fairly
;; complex sub-tree representing the attribute value. On the other hand,
;; in HTML, where all attributes have simple string values, methods to
;; directly access an attribute value can safely be used as a
;; convenience.

;; Interface Text

;; The Text interface inherits from CharacterData and represents the
;; textual content (termed character data in XML) of an Element or Attr.
;; If there is no markup inside an element's content, the text is
;; contained in a single object implementing the Text interface that is
;; the only child of the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into
;; the information items (elements, comments, etc.) and Text nodes that
;; form the list of children of the element.

;; When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one
;; Text node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent Text nodes
;; that represent the contents of a given element without any intervening
;; markup, but should be aware that there is no way to represent the
;; separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they will not (in
;; general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The normalize() method
;; on Node merges any such adjacent Text objects into a single node for
;; each block of text.

;; Character data is represented as a plain string.
