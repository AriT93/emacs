;;; Commentary:

;; If you are working with XML documents, you may parse the documents
;; using the XML parser included with Emacs (xml.el), and pass the data
;; structure to the DOM implementation (dom.el).  You can then use XPATH
;; to find DOM nodes.

;;; Test:

;; The test code assumes a file named sample.xml with the following
;; content:

;;   <book id="compiler">
;;     <bookinfo>
;;       <bookbiblio>
;;         <title>My own book!</title>
