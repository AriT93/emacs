;;; Commentary:

;; multi-mode-mode is a fairly easy way to have the correct major mode
;; anytime, even when editing files where different kinds of code are held
;; together. A paradigmatic situation is e.g. in bash scripts which
;; create, say, a C header file or a Makefile. 


;;; Installation:

;;   Just compile `multi-mode-mode.el' and put it in your load-path.

;; Add to your `~/.emacs.el':
;;  (load-library "multi-mode-mode")
;;  ; uncomment following to activate multi-mode-mode at startup	       
;;  ; (multi-mode-mode 1)						       
;;  ; uncomment following and bind to anything you like to quickly change mode 
;;  ;(global-set-key [f9] ' multi-mode-cond-switch)

;; Usage: 

;; You have to manually insert the mode-switch markers in the files
;; you want this to work in. For example, if you have a large
;; scratch-file like I do (been keeping one since 1997, it's now >
;; 27000 lines and still growing) and want to "mark" different code
;; snippets for easy mode-switching, it might look like this:

;; ---- snip ----

;; -*-Mode: c -*-

;; int some_c_code(char* v, int c);

;; -*-Mode: lisp -*-

;; (defun my-defun ()
;;   (interactive)
;;   (message "my defun is very nice"))

;; ---- snap ----
;; (Thanks to Barman Brakjoller for this)

;;; TODO

;; * find a way to make the check happen whenever you move the point
;; * better format the "wrong mode string warning"
