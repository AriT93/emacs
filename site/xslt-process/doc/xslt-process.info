1 What is it?
*************

 _XSLT-process_ is a minor mode for XEmacs or GNU Emacs which
transforms it into a powerful XML editor with XSLT processing and
debugging capabilities.  You can invoke an XSLT processor of choice
on the current XML file you're editing, and see the results in
another buffer. In case of errors, the error messages generated by
the XSLT processor, are shown in a compilation buffer, which allows
you to quickly go to the location of the error.  You can also run
the XSLT processor in debugging mode, and view step by step what the
XSLT processor is doing. You can view the current stack frame in the
XSLT program, the current XML context node being processed, the
output from the execution of the stylesheet as it is being produced,
what are the local and global variables, set breakpoints in both the
XML source file and the XSLT program.  The principal author of
the _XSLT-process_ package is Ovidiu Predescu
(http://webweavertech.com/ovidiu/weblog/); major contributions have
been made by Tony Addyman
(http://www.cs.salford.ac.uk/web/home.nsf/key/addyman/). The package
is distributed under the terms of GNU General Public License
(http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).  The project is graciously
hosted by SourceForge, and could be found at
http://xslt-process.sourceforge.net/index.php
(http://xslt-process.sourceforge.net/index.php). The current version
is 2.2.

2 Installation and setup
************************

 The _XSLT-process_ mode is part of XEmacs, but it works with both
XEmacs and GNU Emacs. The installation differs slighly between the two
editors as we will see shortly.  The mode has been tested on Linux
and Windows 2000, with XEmacs and GNU Emacs, and under MacOS X with
GNU Emacs (http://webweavertech.com/ovidiu/emacs.html). The
development platform however is Linux, so expect this to be the most
stable one.

2.1 Package installation under XEmacs
=====================================

 _XSLT-process_ is also released as an XEmacs package, so if you're
an XEmacs user, chances are that the package is already installed with
your XEmacs installation. If it's not installed, try obtaining the
latest XEmacs package from your XEmacs local mirror or from the main
XEmacs ftp site. It may happen that the XEmacs package is a little
older than the currently released version of _XSLT-process_, in
which case you want to follow the steps described below.  You can
retrieve the XEmacs package either manually from the ftp site, or by
using the "Options" => "Manage packages" menu. Follow the
instructions described under the "Options" => "Manage packages" =>
"Help" menu entry if you're not familiar with this procedure.

2.2 Generic installation
========================

 This section describes how to install _XSLT-process_ on your Emacs
editor, assuming either it is not already installed, or you want to
install a new version.  The _XSLT-process_ package depends on two
other packages: 
     

   * elib 1.0 (ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz) 

   * speedbar (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml)

2.2.1 Installing Elib
---------------------

 If you're running XEmacs, you don't need to install _Elib_, as
XEmacs by default comes with it.  _Elib_ provides some useful
functionality to Emacs, among other things a compatibility layer
between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.  To install, download it from
ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz
(ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz), and unpack it
into your `~/emacs' directory. If you don't have a `~/emacs'
directory, create one now.  Go to the `elib-1.0' directory and run

     make
   


File: xslt-process.info,  Node: Installing Speedbar,  Next: Installing XSLT-process,  Prev: Installing Elib,  Up: Generic installation

2.2.2 Installing Speedbar
-------------------------

 _XSLT-process_ depends on _Speedbar_, for displaying breakpoints,
stack frames and global and local variables. You need to obtain and
install this package first, in case you don't have it already
installed.  To verify if you have this package installed, type
`M-x speedbar-version'; this will give either an error, if the
package is not installed, or the version number of the _speedbar_
package if it's already installed. You should have at least version
0.13a for _XSLT-process_ to work.  In case you don't have the
_speedbar_ package, you can obtain it from its Web site
(http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml). Unpack the package in
your `~/emacs' directory. Then go to the `speedbar' directory and
run 
     $ make
    If you're using XEmacs, you need to run: 
     $ make EMACS=xemacs
    This step byte-compiles all the Lisp files in the _speedbar_
package using your Emacs editor. Please follow Speedbar's installation
document for more up-to-date information on how to compile it.

2.2.3 Installing _XSLT-process_
-------------------------------

 To install the _XSLT-process_ mode, first obtain the latest stable
version from the SourceForge Web site, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslt-process/
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslt-process/). Unpack the
distribution in your `~/emacs' directory; this will create the
`xslt-process-2.2' directory in your `~/emacs' directory.  You
now need to tell Emacs to look for the new package in this newly
created directory. You do this by adding the following lines in the
Emacs configuration file `~/.emacs' (if you don't have such a file,
create one now): 
     (require 'cl)
     
     (mapc (lambda (x)
             (pushnew (expand-file-name x) load-path))
           (list "~/emacs"
                 "~/emacs/xslt-process-2.2/lisp"
                 "~/emacs/elib-1.0"
                 "~/emacs/speedbar-0.14beta4"))
    You can remove the reference to `elib-1.0' or
`speedbar-0.14beta4' in the lines above, if you didn't have to
install either _elib_ or _speedbar_ as described in the previous
sections.

2.3 Setting up the _XSLT-process_ mode
======================================

 _XSLT-process_ is an Emacs minor mode, which means is extending the
functionality of whatever mode you use for editing XML or XSLT files,
instead of creating a similar one.  _XSLT-process_ does not try to
help in the editing of XML or XSLT files, it just enables Emacs to
process such files. Thus _XSLT-process_ should work with any XML/XSLT
editing mode your Emacs is configured for.  _XSLT-process_ was
tested with both Lennart Staflin's PSGML major mode
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/psgml) and James Clark's
_sgml-mode.el_ major mode (distributed with GNU Emacs) for editing
XML files. It also works with Tony Graham's xslide
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslide) XSLT editing mode.  To
automatically enable the _XSLT-process_ minor mode for the above
major modes, add the following lines in your `~/.emacs' file: 
     (autoload 'xslt-process-mode "xslt-process" "Emacs XSLT processing" t)
     (autoload 'xslt-process-install-docbook "xslt-process"
       "Register the DocBook package with XSLT-process" t)
     (add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook 'xslt-process-mode)
     (add-hook 'xml-mode-hook 'xslt-process-mode)
     (add-hook 'xsl-mode-hook 'xslt-process-mode)
     
     (defadvice xml-mode (after run-xml-mode-hooks act)
       "Invoke `xml-mode-hook' hooks in the XML mode."
       (run-hooks 'xml-mode-hook))
    You can also manually switch to this minor mode by typing `M-x
xslt-process-mode'.  You can check the modeline to see whether
Emacs is in the _XSLT-process_ mode. Look for the "XSLT" indicator in
the modeline.

2.4 Convenience Settings
========================

 Many of the benefits of Emacs in general, and the _XSLT-process_
mode in particular, require the use of a three-button mouse. Under
Linux the emulation of the middle button can be provided by the
operating system. If you are using Windows you can configure Emacs to
provide the same emulation by adding the following lines in your
`~/.emacs' file: 
     ; emulate three button mouse
     (setq w32-num-mouse-buttons 2)

3.1 Setting up the XSLT processor
=================================

 The _XSLT-process_ mode comes by default with two different Java
XSLT processors, Saxon and Xalan. These particular versions of the
XSLT processors (Saxon-6.5.2 and Xalan-2.4.1) have been tested and
work with the _XSLT-process_ mode. Different versions of the
processors may not work with the _XSLT-process_ mode.  You can
choose either of the above processors to do the XSLT processing by
selecting one from the "XSLT" => "XSLT Processor" menu. The default
XSLT processor is Saxon.  


File: xslt-process.info,  Node: Viewing the results of the XSLT processing,  Next: Dealing with errors,  Prev: Setting up the XSLT processor,  Up: Running the XSLT processor

3.2 Viewing the results of the XSLT processing
==============================================

 The main functionality of the _XSLT-process_ mode is to allow you
to edit an XML document, apply an XSLT stylesheet to the document, and
view the results in a buffer, a Web browser, or a PDF viewer.  
To run the XSLT processor and view the results in another Emacs
buffer, you can enter `C-c C-x v', while editing the XML document.
 If your stylesheet generates HTML as the result, you can view the
results directly in a Web browser by typing `C-c C-x n'. If your
stylesheet generates XML FO as output, _XSLT-process_ can translate
it to PDF automatically using the Apache FOP processor
(http://xml.apache.org/fop). In this case just type `C-c C-x p' and
_XSLT-process_ will take care of applying the XSLT stylesheet on your
input XML document, and applying the FOP processor (currently version
0.20.4) on the resulting XSLFO document.  If you choose to view the
results in a buffer, they will be shown in the `*xslt results*'
buffer. If any message are generated during the XSLT processing, they
are shown separately in the `*xslt messages*' buffer.  You can
customize the Web browser and PDF viewer to be used as described in
*Note Customizing the XSLT-process mode::. If you don't like the
default key bindings described above, you can also customize them as
described in the same chapter.  If the FOP processor is used, any
error messages, logging information, etc. is sent to the `*Messages*'
buffer. The level of logging provided by the FOP processor can be
customized (see *Note Customizing the XSLT-process mode::). 
*Note_* The use of the FOP processor causes two temporary files to be
created in your temporary directory. These are `xslt-process-output.fo'
and `xslt-process-output.pdf'. If `xslt-process-output.pdf' is
already being displayed when a new version of the file is generated
the outcome depends on the PDF viewer being used: either a second
window may be opened, so both versions of the file are displayed, or
only the original file is displayed. If a second window is not opened
the `xslt-process-output.pdf' file must be closed and re-opened
manually to view the new version.  *Note_* This use of your
temporary directory will fail if the path to the temporary directory
contains spaces. This is the default setting for some versions of
Windows.

3.3 Dealing with errors
=======================

 The _XSLT-process_ mode intercepts the error messages generated by
the XML parser or XSLT processor and displays them in compilation
buffer, which quickly allows you to go to the cause of the error. 
When you encounter an error, just click using the middle-button
(assuming an X-Windows system or suitable three-button emulation) on
the error message. Emacs will move the cursor point at the place that
caused the error. If you only have a two-button mouse you should can
emulate the third button using the operating system (Linux) or Emacs
(Windows) (see *Note Convenience Settings::).

3.4 Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document
=======================================================

 There are two ways to specify a stylesheet to be used to process an
XML file. The first method uses the so-called `associated
stylesheet', a XML specific feature, which is specified inside the
XML file. The second method is external to the XML, and is specific
to the _XSLT-process_ mode.

* Using the associated stylesheet::  
* The stylesheet registry::     
   


File: xslt-process.info,  Node: Using the associated stylesheet,  Next: The stylesheet registry,  Prev: Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document,  Up: Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document

3.4.1 Using the associated stylesheet
-------------------------------------

 The XSLT file that's used to process the file should be specified
inside the XML file using the XML processing instruction
`xml-stylesheet', like this: 
     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <?xml-stylesheet href="URL/to/XSLT/file" type="text/xsl"?>
     
     ...
    You can use any URI understood by your Java system, e.g. file,
HTTP or FTP, to refer to a stylesheet. The XSLT engine will download
the stylesheet from the remote location and make use of it locally.
The XSLT processing code of _XSLT-process_ is written such that the
stylesheet is cached, so further invocations won't parse the
stylesheet again, unless the stylesheet is modified.  You can use
URLs which are relative to the location of your XML file. For example
if you have an XSLT file `page-html.xsl' in the same directory as the
XML file you can simply have inside the XML file the following
processing instruction: 
     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <?xml-stylesheet href="page-html.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>
     
     ...
   


File: xslt-process.info,  Node: The stylesheet registry,  Prev: Using the associated stylesheet,  Up: Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document

3.4.2 The stylesheet registry
-----------------------------

 Using the associated stylesheet in the XML document requires the
XML document to have a `xml-processing' pseudo-instruction. This is
not always convenient, so _XSLT-process_ provides a way to associate
XSLT stylesheets with XML documents.  The stylesheet registry
functionality can be found in the menu under "XSLT" => "Stylesheets
Registry".   Associating an XSLT stylesheet with and XML document
requires the following steps: 
     

   * Registering the XSLT stylesheet into the stylesheet registry.
     Only stylesheets registered with the registry can be associated
     with an XML document.  To register a stylesheet in the
     registry, type `C-c C-x b'. This will prompt you for the buffer
     name visiting the XSLT stylesheet. Select the buffer visiting
     the XSLT stylesheet you want; you can type `TAB TAB' for a list
     of buffers. 

   * Once you have registered stylesheets with the registry, you can
     associate XML documents with stylesheets registered with the
     registry. Select the buffer visiting the XML document you want and
     type `C-c C-x a'. You will be prompted in a buffer to choose
     which currently registered XSLT stylesheet you want to be
     associated with the current XML document.  If you already
     have an association between the XML document and an XSLT
     stylesheet, it will be selected. If there is no association
     already established, the default is setup to use the associated
     stylesheet specified with the `xml-stylesheet'
     pseudo-instruction. There is no check being done to ensure you
     have such an instruction. 
     To remove or add new XSLT stylesheets, you can type `C-c C-x
m'. This will present you a buffer that allows you to remove existing
stylesheets, or to manually add new ones. Adding new ones may be
easier though by visiting the file in a buffer, and typing `C-c C-x
b'.  Managing the associations between XML documents and XSLT
stylesheets is done in a similar way. Just type `C-c C-x h', and
you'll get a buffer that shows you all the currently registered
associations.  If you want to persist the registry across multiple
invocations of Emacs, you need to save it. You can do this from
"XSLT" => "Stylesheets Registry" => "Save registry". 


File: xslt-process.info,  Node: Changing the XSLT processor,  Prev: Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document,  Up: Running the XSLT processor

3.5 Changing the XSLT processor
===============================

 If you want to experiment what are the results of applying your
stylesheets using different XSLT processors, you can change the
processor using the menu "XSLT" => "XSLT Processor", or by using the
customization interface (see *Note Customizing the XSLT-process
mode::). If you are in the middle of a debugging session, the change
will not take effect until the current session is ended using "Quit
XSLT processor".  In certain cases, there are XSLT stylesheets that
works only when processed through a particular XSLT processor. This
may happen because the stylesheet is using XSLT extensions specific
to a particular processor. In this case you can specify the XSLT
processor to be used in the XML source document (see *Note Known
problems and limitations::).  Just add a _Local Variables_ section
at the end of your XML file and specify within it what should be the
XSLT processor to be invoked using the `processor' variable. For
example, by adding the following section at the end of your file, you
specify _Saxon_ to be used as the XSLT processor, no matter what is
the global XSLT processor setting: 
     <!--
     Local Variables:
     processor: Saxon
     End:
     -->
    A _Local Variables_ section can be used in the same way at the
end of your XSL file provided that this file is the current buffer
when the XSLT process is executed. This only works if the XSL file is
associated with your XML file using the "Stylesheets Registry",
otherwise the current buffer will be treated as the XML file.  In
this release, the acceptable values for `processor' are `Saxon' and
`Xalan', as they are the only supported processors. By replacing the
value of `processor', you can run any of the supported processors on
your file.

4 The XSLT debugger
*******************

 For relatively simple XSLT stylesheets, understanding how a
particular stylesheet works can be done by repeteadly running the
XSLT processor, and looking at the results. More complex stylesheets
however, are difficult to debug this way, especially when you have
lots of XSL variables and key indices.  _XSLT-process_ gives you
the ability to run the processor in debugging mode, which allows you
to set breakpoints, run step by step, view local and global XSLT
variables, and view the output as it is being generated. This release
supports debugging using both Saxon and Xalan.  *Note_* Saxon and
Xalan operate quite differently internally. This is reflected in the
information displayed by the debugger during the execution of the
stylesheet, sequencing, details of the handling of breakpoints, etc.

4.1 Entering the debug mode
===========================

 While you're editing an XML or XSLT file, the buffer visiting the
file is read-write, allowing you to perform the normal editing
operations, and use the functionality specific to the XML/XSLT/SGML
mode you're using.  The XSLT debugging mode however does not
allow you to modify files, and it binds some of the keys to debugger
specific functionality. The XSLT debugging functionality is a per
buffer feature, you can enable and disable it for each buffer
independently.  To toggle the XSLT debugging functionality, type
`C-c C-x d' while you're in a _XSLT-process_ mode buffer. You can
also toggle the debug mode through the menu at "XSLT" => "Toggle
debug mode". Once you enter the debug mode, you will notice the
modeline indicator changes from "XSLT" to "XSLTd".   In the
menu, you will observe that until the debug functionality is not
enabled, all the debugger related operations in the menu are
disabled. Once you enable the debug mode, you will be able to setup
breakpoints and run the XSLT debugger.

4.2 Breakpoints
===============

 Once you're in the XSLT debugging mode, you can set or delete,
enable or disable breakpoints. During the execution of the XSLT
stylesheet, the XSLT processor will stop when it reaches a breakpoint
that is enabled.  The keybindings for breakpoints are: 
     

   * `b': Set a new breakpoint at the line containing point. Doesn't
     do anything if a breakpoint is already setup at this location.
      The corresponding menu item is disabled if the point is on a
     line where a breakpoint is already set. 

   * `d': Delete the breakpoint at the line containing point. Nothing
     happens if no breakpoint is setup on the line at point.  The
     corresponding menu item is disabled if the point is on a line
     where there is no breakpoint. 

   * `e': Enable or disable the breakpoint at the line containing
     point. If there is no breakpoint setup at point, nothing
     happens. If the breakpoint is enabled, this action will disable
     it. Similarly, if the breakpoint is disabled, this action will
     enable it.  The corresponding menu item is disabled if the
     point is on a line where there is no breakpoint. 
    The enabled and disabled breakpoints are shown with distinctive
colors, so you can easily identify them.  You can setup
breakpoints both in the source XML document, and in the XSLT
stylesheet program. Note however that the semantic of a breakpoint in
the source document is very different from a breakpoint in the XSLT
stylesheet. The XSLT processor will stop at a breakpoint in the source
document only when an element on that line is "selected", e.g. when
the element becomes the current context node (see the XSLT
(http://www.w3c.org/TR/XSLT) specification). Compare this with the
XSLT stylesheet, which is essentially a program, and where the stop
at a breakpoint means that the execution of the program reached the
instruction at that line.  The two different XSLT processors don't
inform the debugger that an element has been selected in exactly the
same circumstances. Saxon only monitors `xsl:for-each' and
`xsl:apply-templates'; Xalan also monitors `xsl:if', `xsl:choose',
`xsl:copy-of', `xsl:value-of', `xsl:variable' and `xsl:with-param'.

4.3 Controlling the debugger
============================

 After you setup the breakpoints where you would like the XSLT
processor to stop, you can start the XSLT processing. You can do this
from the menu at "XSLT" => "Run debugger", or by typing `r'. 
*Important:* When starting the debugger, the buffer containing the
XML source document should be current. If a buffer containing an XSLT
document is active instead, the _XSLT-process_ mode assumes this as
the source document, and will not be able to find the associated
stylesheet.  The XSLT processor starts. As soon as the XSLT
processor generates some output the `*xslt-output*' window will be
opened to display that output. The processor continues running in the
background until the execution reaches an enabled breakpoint.  
At this point, Emacs will highlight the line where the XSLT processor
has stopped and indicate whether the stylesheet is entering "=>" or
leaving "<=" the element. If necessary the stylesheet will be opened
in a window. The location at which the execution has stopped is also
displayed in the mini-buffer. This shows the filename, line number
and visit count. The "visit count" indicates the number of times this
breakpoint has been visited in succession, i.e. without a visit to
another breakpoint. The debugger will wait for an action to be taken.
The possible actions are: 
     

   * "Step" (keybinding `s'): If the XSLT processor stopped when it
     was about to enter an XML element, it will enter it and stop the
     execution on the first child element, right before entering it.
      If the XSLT processor stopped when it was exiting from an XML
     element, this action will make the processor exit from the
     current element, and stop on the immediatelly following
     element.  This is equivalent with the _step into_ action of
     debuggers for traditional programming languages. 

   * "Next" (keybinding `n'): If the XSLT processor was about to
     enter an XML element, this action will instruct the processor to
     skip the element (this includes on of its sub-elements). The
     processor will stop when it is about to visit the next sibling
     XML element. If there is no such element, the processor will
     stop when entering the next XML element which is to be visited.
      This is equivalent with the _step over_ action of debuggers
     for traditional languages. 

   * "Finish" (keybinding `f'): Instructs the XSLT processor to
     finish the currently executing XSL template, and stop when exiting
     from it. If an enabled breakpoint is reached before the end of
     the template, the XSLT processor will stop there.  This is
     equivalent with the _finish_ action of traditional debuggers.
     

   * "Continue" (keybinding `c'): Instructs the XSLT processor to
     continue the processing until the next enabled breakpoint is
     encountered or until the XSLT processing finishes. 

   * "Stop" (keybinding `a'): In the case of a long processing,
     instruct the XSLT processor to abort it and stop immediately. This
     is useful for stylesheets that take a long time to complete, and
     you forgot to setup the appropriate breakpoints.

4.4 The speedbar
================

 The speedbar is a separate Emacs window that allows you to: 
     

   * View the breakpoints that you've set. The enabled and disabled
     breakpoints are shown with distinctive colors, so you can easily
     identify them.  Clicking on a breakpoint entry in the speedbar
     will move the point to the file and line where the breakpoint is
     set. If the file is not currently opened within Emacs, it will
     be opened and shown in a buffer. 

   * View the stack of source elements that have been selected during
     the processing.  Whenever you click with the middle button
     on such a entry, the point is positioned in the file and line
     where the source element starts. 

   * View the stack of XSLT elements that are currently being executed.
     Each element that has been entered, but not yet exited is being
     shown in the speedbar.  *Note_* This is true if the XSLT
     elements are instructions. However, if the elements are literal
     result elements, nested elements will often appear in this stack
     in sequence when debugging using Xalan.  Clicking with the
     middle button on such a node will position the point in the file
     at line where the element starts. 

   * View the local and global variables declared with `xsl:variable'
     or `xsl:param'.  Each entry for a variable has a little icon
     showing the type of the variable, its name and value. If images
     are not supported by your Emacs (GNU Emacs 20.x and lower), a
     text indication of the type is shown instead.  *Note_* Xalan
     uses lazy evaluation so a variable might not have its value
     computed until it is actually required, i.e. later in the
     processing. So it is possible to step through an `xsl:variable'
     element without the value of the corresponding variable changing
     within the speedbar display. The value will subsequently appear
     when the variable is set prior to being used. In the limit
     variables that are never used might never be set.  Below are
     all the possible XSLT types and how they are displayed by
     speedbar: 
          

        * `boolean' - The text representation of an XSLT boolean is
          `{b}'. 

        * `number' - The text representation of an XSLT number is
          `{n}'. 

        * `string' - The text representation of an XSLT string is
          `{s}'. 

        * `nodeset' or `document fragment' - The text representation of
          this type is `{t}'. 

        * `object' - The text representation of Java object is `{o}'.
          

        * `any' - This is an unknown XSLT type; its text representation
          is `{a}'. 
     
    *Note_* If the text representation exceeds 100 characters it is
truncated, and "..." added to the end to indicate that fact. If the
text representation contains line breaks these are replaced by
paragraph markers "¶" to ensure the value can be displayed on a
single line as required by the speedbar.

5 Customizing the _XSLT-process_ mode
*************************************

 You can customize the _XSLT-process_ mode in a number of ways.
There are several groups of customizations you can do: 
     

   * Select the XSLT processor to be used by the _XSLT-process_ mode.
     

   * Set global parameters for the transformation. 

   * Customize the environment for the Java process that's running the
     XSLT processor. 

   * Customize the faces (the fonts) used when displaying the
     breakpoints, the current line etc. 

   * Customize the key bindings used for invoking the processor and for
     the debugger. 

   * Customize the Web browser and PDF viewer to be used to directly
     view the results of the processing. 

   * Customize the level of logging reported by the FOP processor. 
    You can find all the above customization options under the main
menu, in "XSLT" => "Customize". Alternatively, you can run `M-x
customize-group RET xslt-process' to get to the main customization
page for _XSLT-process_.

6 Known problems and limitations
********************************

The code which facilitates the immediate serialization and incremental
display of the output during debugging has to set the encoding of that
output stream. The coding is set to UTF-8 regardless of any setting
in the stylesheet. This only occurs when debugging. If it is a problem
for users, it may be possible to add a customization option in a
future release.  The following is a list of differences between
GNU Emacs and XEmacs. As the _XSLT-process_ mode was originally
developed under XEmacs, we would appreciate your support in making
the GNU Emacs version behave closer to the XEmacs one. 
     

   * Under GNU Emacs, the keybinding of a command does not appear in
     the menu item in debug mode as they appear under XEmacs.

7 Future enhancements
*********************

 This is a list of features planned for future releases. The list
doesn't specify any particular order in the priority, and the
features may or may not be implemented. 
     

   * Add the ability to evaluate XPath expressions. The context node
     could be either the top node of the XML document or it can be
     specified by putting the point on it.  This would be a very
     useful tool for novice XSLT users to learn XPath (and Emacs ;-).
     This is a non-trivial enhancement, but one of the developers
     would like to have it for teaching purposes. Until this
     enhancement is available consider using XPath Explorer (see
     `http://sourceforge.net/projects/xpe') 

   * Add the ability to go both forward and backwards in time during
     debugging. This would be a nice feature to have for the cases
     where reaching the point of interest in the stylesheet takes a
     lot of time, and the pressing the wrong key makes you miss it.
     
   


File: xslt-process.info,  Node: Changes,  Prev: Future enhancements,  Up: Top

8 Changes
*********

 These are the changes since the 2.1 release: 
     

   * Updated the versions of Saxon, Xalan and FOP supported to be
     6.5.2, 2.4.1, and 0.20.4 respectively. 

   * Debugging using Xalan is now supported. 

   * During debugging sessions the output produced by executing the
     stylesheet is serialized immediately, then displayed and
     incrementally updated in an Emacs window. 

   * Added parameter passing to the XSLT processor. These are
     parameters that are specified to all the stylesheets, in
     addition to any other parameters. They are specified through the
     customization menu. 

   * Logging output, error messages, etc. generated by the FOP
     processor are displayed in the `*Messages*' buffer. The level of
     logging can be customized. 

   * Minor improvements to the display of information during
     debugging. 
   

    These are the changes since the 2.0 release: 
     

   * Added the ability to run Apache's FOP processor on the XML
     document created as a result of the XSLT processing. Suggestion
     from Jeff Rancier <jeff.rancier@softechnics.com>. 

   * Added the ability to pass JVM arguments and properties. Thanks to
     Phillip Lord <p.lord@russet.org.uk> for the idea and initial
     patch. 
   

    These are the changes since the 1.2.2 release: 
     

   * The functionality has been greatly improved, support for debugging
     and error reporting has been added. 

   * The code has been completely overhauled. A new dedicated Java
     command line tool replaces the more generic BSH process. This
     command line tool is the low level interface used by the
     _XSLT-process_ to perform its functionality, and interacts
     directly with the XSLT processors. 

   * The project has been moved to Sourceforge, including CVS source
     tree and previous releases of the code, and is open to public
     participation. Please register on the public mailing list to
     participate in discussions related to _XSLT-process_. 
   

    These are the changes since the 1.2 release: 
     

   * Fixed problem in accessing stylesheets referred by `file:' URIs
     on Windows. Reported by Nicolas Kessler <kessler@balcab.ch>. 
   

    This is the list of changes since the 1.1 release. 
     

   * Added support for the TrAX interface, part of the JAXP API, thanks
     to Allan Erskine <a.erskine@cs.ucl.ac.uk>. Currently Saxon 6.2
     and Xalan2 have been tested. The TrAX interface caches the XSLT
     stylesheets in the processor driver in a compiled form, so the
     speed of the processing is increased. 

   * The mode is now running with GNU Emacs on Windows NT/2000, thanks
     to Allan Erskine <a.erskine@cs.ucl.ac.uk> for figuring out the
     issues. 

   * Changed again the keyboard binding to `C-c C-x C-v', as `C-M-x'
     doesn't work on Windows systems. 

   * The documentation has been reorganized a little bit to be more
     logical. 
   

    This is the list of changes since the 1.0 release. 
     

   * The `xslt-process-additional-classpath' customization variable
     has been introduced. Setup this variable with any additional
     Java classpath components you want to be passed to the BeanShell
     when is first invoked. If you already started a BeanShell, you
     need to kill the corresponding buffer (named `*bsh*') and
     restart it by invoking _XSLT-process_ on a buffer. (Suggestion
     from T. V. Raman <tvraman@almaden.ibm.com>.) 

   * Allow for passing the user agent to the Cocoon processor so that
     multiple browser types can be simulated. This works with a patch
     I submitted against Cocoon 1.8-dev; it was incorporated and
     should be available in the 1.8.1 release. If you need the patch
     before this release, feel free to contact me, I'll gladly send
     it to you. 

   * The way the error messages are displayed has changed, now error
     messages messages encountered during the JVM startup process
     also go in the `*xslt-output*' buffer. 

   * The default keybinding has been changed to `C-M-x' instead of
     `C-c x', to conform to the (X)Emacs keybinding standards.
