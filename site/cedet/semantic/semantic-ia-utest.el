;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Use marked-up files in the test directory and run the analyzer
;; on them.  Make sure the answers are correct.
;;
;; Each file has cursor keys in them of the form:
;;   // -#- ("ans1" "ans2" )
;; where # is 1, 2, 3, etc, and some sort of answer list.

;;; Code:
(require 'semantic)
