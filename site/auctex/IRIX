This is on SGI Irix, trying to install in my home directory (I am not su
on this system).

In INSTALLATION, tell users of IRIX that they need to be running the bash
shell before doing
make
make ... install

Otherwise it will fail:

make listdir=$HOME/elist install
        if [ ! -d /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp ]; then mkdir
/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp; else true; fi ;
Cannot create directory "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp": No such file
or directory
*** Error code 2 (bu21)

Installation of AUC TeX

I've seen this problem with a package that I maintain.  It's because of
screwy Irix make behavior.  Just tell people to run bash & problem is
fixed.
