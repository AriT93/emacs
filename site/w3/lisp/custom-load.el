;; These are for handling :version.  We need to have a minimum of
;; information so `customize-changed-options' could do its job.

;; For groups we set `custom-version', `group-documentation' and
;; `custom-tag' (which are shown in the customize buffer), so we
;; don't have to load the file containing the group.

;; `custom-versions-load-alist' is an alist that has as car a version
;; number and as elts the files that have variables or faces that
;; contain that version. These files should be loaded before showing
;; the customization buffer that `customize-changed-options'
;; generates.

;; This macro is used so we don't modify the information about
;; variables and groups if it's already set. (We don't know when
;; cus-load.el is going to be loaded and at that time some of the
;; files might be loaded and some others might not).
