2 Introduction
**************

Planner is an organizer and day planner for Emacs.  It helps you keep
track of your pending and completed tasks, daily schedule, dates to
remember, notes and inspirations. It is a powerful tool not only for
managing your time and productivity, but also for keeping within easy
keystroke reach all of the information you need to be productive. It can
even publish reports charting your work for your personal web page, your
conscience, or your soon-to-be-impressed boss.

   In fact, because it uses as its building blocks simple plain-text
files, it is an incredibly modular and flexible tool capable of shaping
and handling your personal information in ways whose variety is limited
only by your imagination. Because of this, Planner has a very active and
generous community who regularly share their innovations with each
other. Many of these modules and extensions are included in the archive
that you will download. Once you get the basics down, you'll probably
want to explore some of them. But as you read this manual and work with
Planner, keep in mind that the basic core is actually very simple, and
it might be worth spending time with just that before delving into the
customizations.

   Because they are plain text with very few requirements, the organizer
pages kept by Planner can be as basic or as detailed as you like. Your
pages can be simple to-do lists with no more additional information
than what you would scrawl on a napkin, or they can be a highly
technical affair involving hyperlinks, embedded Lisp code, appointment
schedules and RSS feeds. As with so much in Emacs, it's all up to you.

   To get started with Planner, you first need to download it, and
possibly also the packages it depends on (*note Installation::).

3 Installation
**************

Planner depends on Muse. Information for downloading and installing
Muse can be found at `http://www.mwolson.org/static/doc/muse.html'.

   Make sure that you use the latest Muse release.  Development code
might prove unstable.

3.1 Getting the Files
=====================

Currently, there are three ways to obtain and install Planner. You can
install it from a source archive, Arch repository, or Debian package.

* Menu:

* Installing from a Source Archive::
* Installing from Arch::
* Installing from Debian::


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Installing from a Source Archive,  Next: Installing from Arch,  Prev: Getting the Files,  Up: Getting the Files

3.1.1 Installing from a Source Archive
--------------------------------------

You can install Planner from the source archive packaged and
distributed directly by the maintainer. This archive is provided in
both `.tar.gz' and `.zip' format.

  1. Download and unpack either
     `http://www.mwolson.org/static/dist/planner-latest.tar.gz' or
     `http://www.mwolson.org/static/dist/planner-latest.zip'.

  2. Edit your `~/.emacs' (`_emacs' on Microsoft Windows).

          ;; Add the directories to your load path
          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse/lisp")
          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/planner")
          (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/remember")

          ;; Load planner
          (require 'planner)

3.1.1.1 Updating Your Version
.............................

Download a new version and extract it over the old directory. Don't
forget to delete any byte-compiled files (`*.elc') in the directories
so that the new code will be used.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Installing from Arch,  Next: Installing from Debian,  Prev: Installing from a Source Archive,  Up: Getting the Files

3.1.2 Installing from Arch
--------------------------

Arch allows you to retrieve previous versions and select specific
features and bugfixes. Debian users can install Arch with `apt-get
install tla'. Users of other distributions should see
`http://regexps.srparish.net/www/'.

   To get started with Planner using Arch, you'll need to run some
initial commands to register your local copy of the archive and
retrieve the files.

     # Register the Muse archive
     tla register-archive http://www.mwolson.org/archives/2006

     # Register the Planner archive
     tla register-archive http://arch.gna.org/planner-el/archive-2006

     # Get the Muse archive
     tla get mwolson@gnu.org--2006/muse--main--1.0 muse

     # Download planner module into the planner/ subdirectory
     tla get mwolson@gnu.org--2006-planner-el/planner-el--devel--1.0 planner

   Then add the following lines to your `~/.emacs':

     ;; Add the directories to your load path
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse/lisp")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/planner")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/remember")

     ;; Load planner
     (require 'planner)

   You can also browse the Arch repository on the web at
`http://www.mwolson.org/cgi-bin/archzoom/archzoom.cgi/mwolson@gnu.org--2006/planner'.

3.1.2.1 Updating Your Version
.............................

To stay up-to-date using Arch, here are some commands that might be
useful.

   To list upstream changes not in local copy:

     # Change to the source directory you are interested in. Example:
     cd muse/

     # Display the summary of changes
     tla missing --summary

   To update to the latest version:

     cd muse; tla replay
     cd ../planner; tla replay
     cd ../remember; tla replay

   Don't forget to delete any byte-compiled files (`*.elc') in the
directories so that the new code will be used.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Installing from Debian,  Prev: Installing from Arch,  Up: Getting the Files

3.1.3 Installing from Debian
----------------------------

Debian packages for Planner, Muse, and Remember are available in Debian
proper as the `planner-el', `muse-el', and `remember-el' packages,
respectively.

   If you wish to try experimental packages, add the following lines to
your `/etc/apt/sources.list'

     deb http://www.mwolson.org/debian/ ./

   Then, do the following steps as root:

     apt-get update
     apt-get install muse-el
     apt-get install planner-el

3.1.3.1 Updating Your Version
.............................

If you installed Planner from Debian, do `apt-get update; apt-get
upgrade' to upgrade all packages that can be upgraded, or `apt-get
update; apt-get install planner-el' to upgrade just planner-el.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Creating Your Planner,  Next: Components,  Prev: Getting the Files,  Up: Installation

3.2 Creating Your Planner
=========================

Now that you have installed the files for Planner and Muse, you need to
set some options to create your first planner.

   Muse thinks in terms of projects. Each project consists of a group of
documents and certain information associated with these documents.
Planner is organized as a project within Muse. So, you need to tell
Muse a bit about it.

   Add something like the following code to your `.emacs' file.

   First, give your new Planner project a name. In this case, we use the
name, "WikiPlanner".

     (setq planner-project "WikiPlanner")

   Next, add an entry for your project to Muse's master list of
projects. Don't forget to use your own name here in place of
"WikiPlanner" if you have chosen something different.

     (setq muse-project-alist
           '(("WikiPlanner"
              ("~/Plans"           ;; where your Planner pages are located
               :default "TaskPool" ;; use value of `planner-default-page'
               :major-mode planner-mode
               :visit-link planner-visit-link)

              ;; This next part is for specifying where Planner pages
              ;; should be published and what Muse publishing style to
              ;; use.  In this example, we will use the XHTML publishing
              ;; style.

              (:base "planner-xhtml"
                     ;; where files are published to
                     ;; (the value of `planner-publishing-directory', if
                     ;;  you have a configuration for an older version
                     ;;  of Planner)
                     :path "~/public_html/Plans"))))

   This code should work fine as-is for you as long as the directories
you see exist, and as long as you have no other Muse projects besides
your planner.

   The first directory (`~/Plans') is the directory where the source
files for your planner will reside. This is the directory where you
will actually visit files and edit them.  These files must have a
".muse" extension.

   The second directory (`~/public_html/Plans') is the directory where
your planner files will be published by Muse as XHTML.

   After you have added this code, make sure to either evaluate it or
restart Emacs.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Components,  Next: Advanced Installation,  Prev: Creating Your Planner,  Up: Installation

3.3 Components
==============

Now that you have the archive, let's look at what's in it.

   There should be three directories, named `planner', `muse' and
`remember'.

   In the `planner/' directory, you'll see many files with names like
`planner-gnus.el'. These are extra modules and extensions for Planner,
which you can use to tailor Planner to fit your desired planning and
information management habits.

   In the `muse/lisp' directory, you'll see many files with names like
`muse-blosxom.el'. As in `planner/', these are optional modules and
extensions.

   A minimal working installation includes just `planner/planner.el'.

   You need `planner.el' because it provides the core functions for
handling tasks, notes, and page navigation. You need `Emacs Muse'
because it provides the functions used to display your pages (both in an
emacs buffer and as HTML), and for connecting them to each other. More
specifically, it enables you to have hyperlinks and formatting in your
emacs buffers even though the actual files you are working with are
saved in plain text. These abilities are used in Planner to format your
planner pages the way you like, to create links from your tasks and
notes to the materials and projects they refer to, and to optionally
"publish" your pages in different formats, including HTML.

   In the `remember/' directory are files related to RememberMode.
RememberMode does not depend on Planner or Muse, but works best with
Planner installed. It is not required in order to use Planner, but it
is used by many Planner users to record notes and information to their
planner pages.

   If you are curious, you can open each file in these directories and
read the comments at the top, to get an idea of what each extension is
used for. They are also all detailed later in this manual.

3.4 Advanced Installation
=========================

Once you decide you want to keep Planner around for a while, there are
two additional steps you can take to make using it easier and more
efficient. These steps are optional.

   * You can install `remember.el' and `remember-planner.el' so that
     you can create Planner notes from anywhere. See the documentation
     at `http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/doc/dev/remember/' for more
     information.

   * You can make this document, the Planner info file, appear in the
     index of info files you see when you type `M-x info' or `C-h i' in
     Emacs. The instructions for doing this vary depending on whether
     you have permission to edit certain files on your system. Follow
     the instructions in *Note Installing an Info File:
     (texinfo)Installing an Info File, using something like:

          * Planner: (path/to/planner/Planner). Organizer/day planner
          for Emacs.

     for the new entry in the info `dir' file.

   * You can byte-compile `planner.el', `Muse', `remember.el', or any
     of the optional modules you frequently use, in order to improve
     the speed of their execution. Basically, all you need to do is
     change to the directory of each project and run `make' from the
     command line. To read more detail about byte compilation, see
     *Note Byte Compilation: (elisp)Byte Compilation.

4 Overview
**********

Planner is a plain-text hyperlinked personal information manager for
Emacs that helps you keep track of tasks, notes, and other information.
People use Planner to support different ways of planning one's day,
from Franklin-Covey and David Allen's Getting Things Done to home-brew
hacks. Planner is even used to manage information not normally handled
by a personal information manager, like bugtracking, time tracking, and
team data. If you start by using Planner as a basic TODO and notes
manager, you might find other ways it can help you improve your process.

   You can use Planner to keep track of your tasks, schedule, notes,
and other information you want to store in hyperlinkable text files.
You can get the most benefit out of a personal information manager if
you use it everyday. Most people add `(plan)' to the end of their
`~/.emacs' so that Planner shows today's schedule and unfinished tasks
whenever Emacs starts. If you leave your Emacs running for more than 24
hours, try to get into the habit of running `plan' at least once a day.

   Because your time is important, Planner tries to minimize
distractions, making it easier for you to jot down tasks and notes
without being distracted from your work. People often make tasks based
on the current buffer, so Planner tries to create hyperlinks to
whatever you're looking at so that you can jump back to it easily. The
*Note Getting Started:: tutorial will show you how to set that up for
both tasks and notes.

   The customizability of Planner means you can make your personal
information manager truly personal. Planner strives to be as flexible
as possible, and we would love to adapt Planner to fit your needs.
Browse through our mailing list (*note Getting Help::) to find out how
other people are using Planner, and post your feature requests and bug
reports there!

   Planner is just a tool. It does not dictate a particular way of
planning, although it supports some ways better than it supports
others. If you want to take some time thinking about planning, read the
following reflections for inspiration and ideas. On the other hand, if
you want to hit the ground running, see *Note Getting Started::. If you
already have a specific way of planning in mind, check out *Note Sample
Configuration Files::.

4.1 Planning Based on the Franklin-Covey Approach
=================================================

This is a slightly edited and updated version of an essay by John
Wiegley. Read it if you want to get some insights into one way of
planning. You can skip this if you want to go straight to planning your
day.

   What is planning?  It can be a nebulous thing to define.  In its
essence, however, it is very simple: it's how we achieve our dreams.

   Our days are filled with time, and hence with actions, whether they
be of a mental or physical sort.  But there are two kinds of action:
reactive and creative.  Reactive action is a response to the
environment, a reaction to stimulus.  Had we enough instincts to ensure
survival, we could live according to this kind of action alone.  It is
a mode of behavior we share with every living species.

   The opposite to reactivity is creativity, when we decide upon a
course of action that is a wholly a product of personal choice.  We
then make decisions as to the steps needed to make this wish a reality.
This is planning.  Planning is essentially a creative endeavor at
every step.

   First, create the idea, what you want to achieve.  Very short-term
ideas do not need much more than thinking about how to do it.  But
long-term ideas require planning, since the mind cannot contain all of
the details.

   Second, decide how the idea maps into the circumstances you find
yourself in.  Some environments will assist your plan, others hinder
it.  But step by step, identify every barrier to the realization of
your idea, and devise a countermeasure to overcome it.  Once you've
mapped things out from beginning to end, accounting for unknowables as
best you can, you now have your plan.

   Third is to break the stages of the plan into parts that are not
overwhelming in their complexity.  It is at during this phase that a
plan is turned into task items, each to be accomplished within the span
of one day's time.  If a task requires several days, break it up
further.  The smaller it is, the less your mind will recoil from
attempting it.

   Fourth is to monitor your progress, identifying problems and
correcting for them as you go.  Some plans start out unachievable, and
remain that way indefinitely, due to a simple lack of observation.  If
nothing is working for you, change it.  Otherwise, your plan is merely
a well-crafted wish.

   Fifth is just to do the work, and be patient.  All good plans take a
great deal of time, and *cannot* happen immediately.  The groundwork
must be laid for each step, or else it will rest on an unsecure
foundation.  If you follow your plan doggedly, applying some time to it
each day or week, it _will_ happen.  Remember the story of the tortoise
and the hare.  I've even written a short essay on the necessity of
gradual accomplishment, which can be found at
`http://emacswiki.org/johnw/essays/node2.html'.

   How can this software help?  Computers are ideal for manipulating
information, since they allow you to change things without erasing or
rewriting.  And since all plans change quite a bit during their
implementation, a planning program can be very helpful.

   Start by adding the following to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (load "planner")

   Now, conceive your idea.  I can't believe there's nothing you want
from life.  More peace, time to enjoy the world, an end to war?
Everyone wants something.  Search deeply, and you will find countless
unhoped wishes lurking therein.  Choose one for now, and think on it
for a while.

   Then open a file (using `C-x C-f') within the directory named by
`planner-directory'.  Emacs will automatically recognize this file as a
planner file.  Name the file after your plan, such as `BetterHealth'.

   Choose an idea you really want to accomplish.  Struggle to
differentiate between the things you want because others want them, and
the things you want for yourself.  It takes quite an effort, and may
require a long time before you notice the difference.  Many people want
to be more healthy to be more attractive, which is an externally driven
goal.  Unless _you_ really want to accomplish what you envision, the
odds are you will fail.  Only our own wishes and dreams possess enough
personal energy to see themselves to fruition.  What happens to many of
us is simply that we never become conscious of these dreams: what we
love, what we desire most.  When I talk to friends, so much of what I
hear is things they want because they feel they should want them.
There's just not enough energy there to pursue a good plan, because
nearly all of it is negative energy.

   Do you know what you really want?  Don't worry, many people don't.
It's not a question anyone really wants us to pursue, because often we
don't want what others do; it doesn't contribute to the social welfare,
and all that nonsense.  Somehow we always forget that what's good for
the social welfare now, was someone else's crazy dream a hundred years
ago.  The human aversion to fundamental change is always one's greatest
enemy, so don't waste any time getting bitter about it.

   For the sake of argument I assume you really do want to be
healthier, because you've fallen in love with the ideal of purity, or
you understand the connection between your physical self and the world
around you, and how this can open up your spirit to desiring more.  I
assume.  :)

   So you're in a Wiki file called `BetterHealth'.  Start typing.  Type
anything related to your idea: what you think about it, your ideas on
it, _and especially what the end will look like_.  If you can't
visualize the end, you can't plan, since planning is about drawing a
line between now and then.

   When you've typed enough to gain a vision of your goal, start
drafting what the possible intermediate steps might be.  Then stop, get
up, walk around, enjoy life, and come back to it.  Taking a long time
at the beginning is not a bad idea at all, as long as it's not forever.

   As you chew on your idea, it will begin to become more and more
concrete.  You'll have ideas about the smallest pieces, and ideas about
the biggest pieces.  Keep going until it starts to take shape before
you, and you can see yourself in your mind's eye moving from the
present into the future.  Write down this progression, and the sorts of
things you might encounter along the way.

   As you continue, you'll naturally discover discrete phases, or
"milestones" as managers love to call them.  These are very important,
because they let you know you're making progress.  I recommend having a
big party with friends every time you achieve a milestone.  A typical
plan might have between three and ten.

   Between the milestones are the bigger pieces of your plan.  Name
these pieces using MixedCase words, and you'll notice that Emacs colors
and underlines them for you.  Like, FindGoodGym.  Hit return on this
highlighted word, and you'll find yourself in another, blank file.  In
this file, start drafting your sub-plan, just as you did with the
larger plan.  You should find it easier now, since the scope is smaller.

   As you break down further, you'll notice simple little things that
need to get done.  These are your tasks.  Every plan is a succession of
tasks.  The difference from reactivity is that each task is part of the
larger plan. This is what it means to be systematic: that everything
you do helps further your plan.  If you have tasks in your day that
contribute to no plan, they are reactive.  Of course, life is full of
these, but don't let them take up more than 20% of your day.  If you
allow yourself to be dominated by reactive tasks, you'll regret it at
the end of your life.  I don't know this personally, but I do know that
striving for one's dreams - and seeing them come to fruition - is the
greatest joy a man can possess.  It is the essence of freedom, of
living, of creation.  Reactivity is the opposite of this, and serves
only to drain our energy and slacken our spirits.

   Now that you've thought of a simple task, type `C-c C-t'. This will
ask for a brief description of the task, and when you plan to do it. If
you hit <RETURN> at the question `When', it assumes you mean today. It
will also pop up a three-month calendar at this question, so you can
see where your free days are. Make sure you set the variable
`mark-diary-entries-in-calendar' to `t' in your `.emacs' (or `_emacs')
file. This way, you can see which days your appointments fall on. (Read
about the Emacs Calendar and Diary in *Note Calendar/Diary:
(Emacs)Calendar/Diary.)

     (setq mark-diary-entries-in-calendar t)

   Once your task is in there, go back to your plan and keep generating
more tasks.  Generate them all!  Fully describe--as tasks--everything
necessary to bring your sub-plan to completion.  Don't create tasks for
the other sub-plans.  You may have good idea of what they'll look like,
but don't bother rendering them into tasks just yet.  Things will
change too much between now and then, for that to be a good use of your
time.

   Is your sub-plan now rendered into all of the tasks necessary to
reach your first milestone?  Great!  That is the purpose of planner.el.
The rest is really up to you.  If you find that you keep putting
things off, and never do them, that's the surest sign you're planning
for someone else's dream, and not your own.

   Here are some of the things planner.el can do, to help you manage
and track your tasks:

   At the beginning of every day, type `M-x plan'.  This will jump you
to the top of the most recent task list before today.  If you skipped a
bunch of days, you'll have to open up those files on your own.

   Probably some of the tasks that day won't be finished - that's OK.
Learning to properly estimate time is a magical, mystical art that few
have mastered.  Put your cursor on those undone tasks, and type `C-c
C-c'.  This will move them into today's task page.  You can jump to
today's task page at any time by typing `C-c C-n' (from a Wiki or
planning page).  I heartily recommend binding `C-c n', to jump you to
this page from anywhere:

     (define-key mode-specific-map [?n] 'planner-goto-today)

   As you look at your task sheet each day, the first thing to do is to
"clock in" to one of them.  This isn't necessary, and is only helpful
if you're around your computer a lot.  But by typing `C-c C-i'
(assuming you have my `timeclock.el' on your load-path), it will log
the time you spend working on your sub-plan (*note Time Intervals:
(Emacs)Time Intervals.).  This is helpful for viewing your progress.
Type `C-c C-o' to clock out.

   `C-M-p' and `C-M-n' will move a task up and down in priority.
Priority is represented by a letter A through C.  'A' tasks mean they
must be done that day, or else your plan is compromised and you will
have to replan.  'B' means they should be done that day, to further the
plan, otherwise things will be delayed.  'C' means you can put off the
task if you need to, although ultimately it will have to be done.

   For reactive tasks, the letters mean something different: 'A' means
you must do it today, or somebody will roast your chestnuts over an
open fire.  'B' means you should do it today, or else someone will be
practicing patience at the day's end.  'C' means no one will notice if
you don't do it.

   Again, reactive tasks are ENEMIES OF PLANNING.  Really, until you
see them that way, circumstances will push you around and steal your
life away.  We have only so many years to use, and everyone is greedy
to take them.  It's insidious, almost invisible.  A healthy dislike of
reactivity will do wonders for organizing your affairs according to
their true priority.

   The last word that needs to be said concerns "roles".  Every person
stands in several positions in his life: husband, employee, manager,
etc.  These roles will tend to generate tasks not associated with any
immediate plan, but necessary to maintain the health and functioning of
the role.  My suggestion is to keep this the smallest possible number,
and fulfill those that remain well.  How you decide to apportion your
time between pursuing grand designs, and fostering deep relationships,
is a personal matter.  If you choose well, each will feed the other.

   I mention this to point that reactivity is something not exclusively
associated with tasks that have no master plan, because being a father,
for example, is something that rarely proceeds according to orderly
plans.  But the role of father itself is its own plan, whose goal is
"to be the best one can", and whose component tasks are spending time
on whatever comes up.  It is, in a sense, an implicit plan.  But
reactive tasks follow no plan at all; they are parasites of time that
suck the spirit away, whereas properly chose roles actually help
fulfill one's own inner needs.  At least, this is what I believe.

 -- Function: plan force-days
     Start your planning for the day, beginning with the last day's
     tasks.

     If `planner-carry-tasks-forward' is non-nil, find the most recent
     daily page with unfinished tasks and reschedule those tasks to the
     current day.  If FORCE is non-nil, examine all past daily pages
     for unfinished tasks.

     If `planner-carry-tasks-forward' is nil, visit the most recent
     daily page.  If a daily page for today exists, visit that instead.

     If FORCE-DAYS is a positive integer, scan that number of days.  If
     FORCE-DAYS is `t', scan all days.

4.2 Why Use Planner?
====================

You can skip this essay if you just want to get started, or read it for
some insights into why the previous maintainer is crazy about it.

   Why I Use Planner, by Sacha Chua

   I thought about why I liked Planner. Planner as a TODO manager isn't
particularly special. Although I can assign tasks to categories and see
a breakdown of what projects are taking up my time, Evolution and
Microsoft Outlook provide more powerful task support. In other task
managers, you can e-mail tasks, assign multiple categories and fill in
all sorts of metadata. You can even synchronize your tasks with devices
like a phone or PDA. So why use Planner?

   I realized that integration into my way of life and automatic context
clues are what really make planner tasks worth it for me. I don't have
to switch to another application to create a task. I can just hit a
keyboard shortcut. Planner uses a minibuffer to get the task
description. My windows are not rearranged in any way, and I can look
at the data that's relevant to a task. Not only that, tasks
automatically pick up context clues, like whom I'm talking to on IRC or
the file I'm editing at the moment. This cuts down on the explicit
context I need to include and makes it easier for me to bring up the
task again.

   As a scheduler, Planner is also not particularly distinguished.
Sure, it can display my `~/diary', but for that matter so can `M-x
diary'. Evolution and Outlook can give me a more graphical view of my
time, sync with my PDA, and coordinate my schedule with other people.
Those applications support detailed schedule entries with powerful
cyclic options. On the other hand, Planner gives me a personal, plain
text view and (at least the way I use it) requires me to edit a
separate file to add new appointments. (I've defined a few shortcut
keys to deal with this.) However, it does have one advantage--my
schedule is always loaded. I used to use Outlook on Windows, but having
my schedule in a separate application meant that I actually looked at
it very rarely, as I had turned off reminders because they got annoying.

   Planner's notes, however, are what really convinced me. I can hit a
keyboard shortcut from anywhere and type my notes into a buffer which
automatically keeps context information. After typing the note, I can
then categorize it. I think that the critical thing here is that
interruptions--fleeting thoughts--don't break my flow. I can just pop
up a remember buffer, stow that thought away somewhere, and go back to
it whenever I want. In contrast, creating a note in Outlook means
switching out of my application, making a couple of keystrokes, typing
the note in, and then switching back. The context switches make it hard
to keep track of where I am and what I'm supposed to remember.  Not
only that, I need to enter context by hand. Even though I can color my
notes and reorganize them in Outlook, I find the context switch too
expensive. I used to keep notes in other knowledge management tools as
well. Some applications allowed me to drag-and-drop links into the
current note, and that was cool. But that required a manual action, and
those applications didn't feel integrated into my way of working.
(Note: You'll need remember.el for this.)

   I guess that's why I like Planner. Unlike other organizers which
don't know anything about the applications I use, Planner tries its
best to integrate into the way I work, and it's easy to extend.
Fortunately I do almost all my work in Emacs, so I can think of my
organizer as integrated into my e-mail client, Internet Relay Chat
client, web browser, file editor and even games. It automatically picks
up context clues from these applications and allows me to easily jump
back to relevant files. It doesn't distract me. It allows me to key in
data and then it gets out of my way.

   (That said, it's perfectly okay to use Planner even if you don't live
in Emacs.)

   The processing that happens in the background is a bonus, and
publishing my task list and notes online has greatly helped me. It
gives other people a way to see what I'm working on and what I've
planned for the future. Occasionally people write in with additional
resources and helpful tips. (Again, this is purely optional. Many
people don't publish their planner pages. Other people use really
fine-grained access control.)

   I think the greatest feature of Planner, though, is its user
community. Because Planner can be easily modified, we can experiment
with a lot of new ideas quickly, and we can tailor Planner to fit our
needs. I love checking my `planner-el-discuss' mail and finding out how
people have tweaked Planner or would like to tweak Planner, and I've
learned a lot by exchanging reflections on organizing one's life.

   I really wasn't an organization freak before I started using Planner.
I often forgot to do my homework or answer important mail. I still
procrastinate now, but at least it's all being kept track of somewhere!
I also really like how Planner lets me to gradually improve how I'm
doing things, and I feel I've come a long way.

   Please try it out! We'd love to hear how Planner can become _your_
personal information manager.

5 Getting Started
*****************

At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use Planner and
related modules to keep track of your tasks, schedules and notes, all
within the convenience of Emacs.

   There are two kinds of pages in a Planner wiki. Day pages show tasks,
schedule, and notes for the day, while plan pages organize related tasks
and notes into a single page.

   If you have not yet added planner to your `~/.emacs', add the
following lines:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/muse/lisp")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/planner")
     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/remember")
     (require 'planner)

   This will bring up the most recent day page with unfinished tasks or
create a new day page if necessary. By default, planner pages are
stored in `~/Plans' (`planner-directory').

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Tasks,  Next: Schedule,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Getting Started

5.1 Tasks
=========

Let us start by creating a task labelled

     Join http://mail.gna.org/listinfo/planner-el-discuss/

   From anywhere (even this info buffer!), call `M-x
planner-create-task-from-buffer' to create a new task. Fill in the
description and choose a date by:

   * typing 1 - 31 to put the task on that day of the month,

   * accepting the default (today) by pressing RET,

   * selecting the date with mouse-1,

   * typing +n (where in is an integer) to schedule the task in n days
     time, or

   * typing nil to make an undated task.

   For now, accept the default (`today') by pressing <RET>.

   You will then be prompted for a plan page. Plan pages gather related
tasks and notes, giving you an overview of what you've done so far.
You can accept the default TaskPool, create your own plan page, or
specify nil to make a task that is not associated with a plan page.
For now, accept the default (`TaskPool') by pressing RET.

   You have created your first task. View today's page with `M-x
planner-goto-today'. You will see a line of the form

     #B  _ Join http://mail.gna.org/listinfo/planner-el-discuss/ (TaskPool)

   If you created the task from this page, then there will be an
additional annotation:

     #B  _ Join http://mail.gna.org/listinfo/planner-el-discuss/ : Tasks (TaskPool)

   The URL, `TaskPool' and `Getting Started' are hyperlinks. You can
use TAB and S-TAB to navigate between them and RET to follow the link.

   Create more tasks using `M-x planner-create-task-from-buffer'.  This
is bound to `C-c C-t' in `planner-mode' pages for your convenience. For
example, create the following tasks:

   * `Describe my current way of working and how I would like to work',
     for three days from now (`+3'),

   * `Learn how to schedule a task', an undated task (`nil') on the
     TaskPool page,

   * `Browse through the Planner info manual' for today (`.' or accept
     the defaults), and

   * `Add (plan) to the end of my [[~/.emacs]]' for today, but without a
     plan page (specify `nil' at the plan page prompt)

   Tip: I bind planner-create-task-from-buffer to "F9 t" so that I can
easily call it from anywhere. You can do that with this elisp fragment:
`(global-set-key (kbd "<f9> t") 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)'

   Next, visit the TaskPool by:

   * <TAB>-bing or using the cursor and typing <RET> to follow the link,

   * `C-x C-f TaskPool RET' to use `find-file', or

   * `C-c C-f TaskPool RET' to use `muse-project-find-file'

   You can see an overview of the tasks as scheduled on different days.
Unlike many personal information managers that store all of your data
in one file and then perform magic in order to present different views,
Planner uses plain text files. The data is duplicated and kept updated
by functions. This makes it simpler and easier to modify, because what
you see is (almost) what you get. On the other hand, you'll need to get
used to either editing both files, or using the built-in functions for
editing and updating files. If you prefer not to work with linked
tasks, you can configure Planner to use only plan pages or use only day
pages.

   The TaskPool page should list the tasks you created earlier. Go to
the one named Learn how to schedule a task . Type `C-c C-c'
(`planner-copy-or-move-task') to schedule the task. Type RET to accept
the default (today). Go to the day page by following the link or
calling `M-x planner-goto' (`C-c C-j C-d' or the menu bar); you will
see the newly-created task there. You can also use `C-c C-c'
(`planner-copy-or-move-task') to reschedule a task to an earlier or
later date.

   Well, that task is done. To mark the task as completed, type `C-c
C-x' (`planner-task-done'). You can also edit the status manually
(change _ to X) as long as you remember to call `M-x
planner-update-task' to update the link page as well. Updating relies on
the task description being the same, so do not edit this manually.

   Quick summary of commands:

   * Go to today's page: `M-x plan' to carry unfinished tasks forward,
     or `M-x planner-goto-today' to just go to today's page.

   * Create a task: `C-c C-t' (`planner-create-task-from-buffer'), or
     type a task manually (call M-x planner-update-task if the task is
     linked)

   * Mark a task as done: `C-c C-x' (`planner-task-done'), or edit the
     task and call `M-x planner-update-task'

   * Edit a task description: `M-x planner-edit-task-description'

   * Reschedule a task: `C-c C-c' (`planner-copy-or-move-task')

   * Reschedule many tasks: Mark a region and use `M-x
     planner-copy-or-move-region'

   * Change the plan of a task: `M-x planner-replan-task', or `C-c C-c'
     (`planner-copy-or-move-task') with a plan page

   * Delete a task: `M-x planner-delete-task'

   * Reorder tasks: <M-p> (`planner-raise-task') and <M-n>
     (`planner-lower-task'), or normal editing commands like kill and
     yank

   * Change task priorities (`#A' > `#B' > `#C'):       <C-M-p>
     (`planner-raise-task-priority') and       <C-M-n>
     (`planner-lower-task-priority'),       or edit the task and call
     `M-x planner-update-task'.

   You can save your tasks with `C-x C-s' the same way you save any
other file, or Emacs will prompt you to save it when you exit.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Schedule,  Next: Notes,  Prev: Tasks,  Up: Getting Started

5.2 Schedule
============

This is free-form. You can put anything you want into this, or remove
it from `planner-day-page-template' entirely. Some people use it to
keep track of their plans for the day with tables like this:

     hh:mm | hh:mm | activity
     hh:mm | hh:mm | activity
     hh:mm | hh:mm | activity

   Remember, Planner files are just plain text. You can add new sections
or remove old ones, or use the suggested sections for entirely
different activities.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Notes,  Next: Hyperlinks,  Prev: Schedule,  Up: Getting Started

5.3 Notes
=========

You can put anything you want in this section, or remove it from your
`planner-day-page-template' entirely.

   You may be interested in `remember-planner.el', part of the Remember
package. `remember-planner.el' makes it easy to create notes from
anywhere in Emacs, and it uses the same hyperlink-sensing code that
Planner uses. Notes added by remember-planner.el look like this:

     .#1 Headline 00:00
     Body

   and are outlined at the H2 level in published HTML.

   If you include the following in your `~/.emacs':

     (require 'remember-planner)
     (setq remember-handler-functions '(remember-planner-append))
     (setq remember-annotation-functions planner-annotation-functions)

   you can easily create context-aware notes. `M-x remember' will
create a dedicated buffer for you to fill in your note. If Planner
recognizes the buffer as one with context then it will include a
hyperlink at the bottom. The first line is used as a title, so make it
short and meaningful. The rest of the text will be used as the body of
the note. Try it now by creating a note, perhaps about things you'd
like to remember from this tutorial.

   Typing `C-c C-c' after composing will prompt for a plan page to put
this on, with auto-completion. By default, notes will go on today's
page only. If you specify a plan page, the note will go on today's page
and on the plan page. Let's try specifying `TaskPool' for the note.

   If you look at today's page, you'll find a timestamped note that
links to `TaskPool'. Likewise, `TaskPool' contains a note that links to
today's page. Because the text is copied, changes in one will not be
automatically reflected in the other. To update the linked page after
editing a note, use `M-x planner-update-note'. To change the plan page
of a note, use `planner-replan-note'.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Hyperlinks,  Next: Example Page,  Prev: Notes,  Up: Getting Started

5.4 Hyperlinks
==============

Planner automatically creates context-sensitive hyperlinks for your
tasks and notes when you use `planner-create-task-from-buffer' and
`remember'.

   Blue links indicate URLs and Planner pages that already exist. Red
links indicate Planner pages that have not yet been created.

   Middle-click or type <RET> on any link to view the link in the
current window. Shift-middle-click or type <S-RET> to view the link in
another window. <TAB> goes to the next link, while <S-TAB> goes to the
previous one.

   You can pick up hyperlinks using the `planner-annotation-as-kill'
function.

 -- Function: planner-annotation-as-kill
     Create a context-sensitive hyperlink for the current buffer and
     copy it to the kill ring. When called with a prefix argument,
     prompt for the link display name.

   You can then paste it into any Planner buffer by using `M-x yank' or
the keyboard shortcut.

   Hyperlinks are a powerful feature of Planner. You can use them to
hyperlink to mail, news, Web pages, and even IRC connections. See the
section on *Note Managing Your Information:: to find out how to enable
support for various parts of Emacs. Want to add a new hyperlink scheme?
Check out the source code for examples or ask on the mailing list for

not have a well-defined user interface. Rather, it's free-form and
open, allowing you to adapt it to your preferences.

5.6 Review
==========

   * _Ideas for using planner more effectively:_

        * Add `(plan)' to the end of your `~/.emacs' so that you are
          reminded about your tasks every day.

        * Bind useful functions to shortcut keys and get used to
          creating tasks and notes from anywhere.

        * Think about how you plan your day and look for ways to
          improve it. Ask the mailing list (*note Getting Help::) for
          tips.

        * Browse the rest of this manual, the source code, and other
          resources on the Net for tidbits you can use.

6.1 Starting with Day Pages
===========================

`planner-goto-today' opens today's page.  Day pages are named
`YYYY.MM.DD' and contain your notes for the day.

   You should see a file that looks like this:

     * Tasks


     * Schedule

     * Notes

   You can type anything you want into this file.  You can add or delete
sections.  When you save, Emacs stores your information in
`planner-directory'.

   Use the following commands to navigate through day pages:

 -- Function: plan
     Start planning the day.  If `planner-carry-tasks-forward' is
     non-nil, copy the most recent unfinished tasks to today's page,
     else open the most recent page.

 -- Function: planner-goto (`C-c C-j C-d')
     Prompt for a date using a calendar pop-up and display the
     corresponding day page.  You can specify dates partially.  The
     current year and month are used if omitted from the input.  For
     example, if today is 2004.05.05, then

        * `+1' is one day from now, or `2004.05.06'

        * `-1' is one day before now, or `2004.05.04'

        * `12' is equivalent to `2004.05.12'

        * `8.12' is equivalent to `2004.08.12'

        * `2005.08.12' is a full date specification

     In the calendar buffer, you can also left-click or press <RET> on
     a date to select it.

 -- Function: planner-goto-today (`C-c C-j C-j')
     Display today's page. Create the page if it does not yet exist.

 -- Function: planner-goto-tomorrow (`C-c C-j C-t')
     Goto the planner page days AFTER the currently displayed date.  If
     DAYS is nil, go to the day immediately after the currently
     displayed date.  If the current buffer is not a daily planner page,
     calculate date based on today.

 -- Function: planner-goto-yesterday (`C-c C-j C-y')
     Goto the planner page DAYS before the currently displayed date.
     If DAYS is nil, go to the day immediately before the currently
     displayed date.  If the current buffer is not a daily planner page,
     calculate date based on today.

 -- Function: planner-goto-most-recent
     Go to the most recent day with planning info.

 -- Function: planner-goto-previous-daily-page
     Goto the last plan page before the current date.  The current date
     is taken from the day page in the current buffer, or today if the
     current buffer is not a planner page.  Do not create pages if they
     do not yet exist.

 -- Function: planner-goto-next-daily-page
     Goto the first plan page after the current date.  The current date
     is taken from the day page in the current buffer, or today if the
     current buffer is not a planner page.  Do not create pages if they
     do not yet exist.

 -- Function: planner-goto-plan-page page
     Opens PAGE in the the `planner-project' Wiki.  Use `planner-goto'
     if you want fancy calendar completion.

 -- Function: planner-show date
     Show the plan page for DATE in another window, but don't select
     it.  If no page for DATE exists, return nil.

6.2 More about Tasks
====================

This section is divided into three parts. In the first part, you can
read about all the options, strategies and commands to help you
efficiently add new tasks to your planner. In the second part, we'll go
over all of the aspects of Planner that relate to organizing, editing,
rescheduling and viewing the tasks you've already created. Finally,
we'll cover some ways to step back and look at various reports and
overviews that can be generated from your planner pages.

   You may also be interested in tracking time spent on tasks with
*Note Timeclock:: and estimating project completion time with *Note

6.2.1 Creating New Tasks
------------------------

Planner makes it very easy to quickly add something to your list of
tasks. Once you get used to the basics of
`planner-create-task-from-buffer', you might want to take a closer look
at some things in Planner that can help you create new tasks in a way
that fits with your system.

* Menu:

* Creating a Task::
* Task Priorities::
* Task IDs::                    planner-id.el
* Cyclic Tasks::                planner-cyclic.el

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Creating a Task,  Next: Task Priorities,  Prev: Creating New Tasks,  Up: Creating New Tasks

6.2.1.1 Creating a Task
.......................

You can create a task from any buffer in Emacs by invoking `M-x
planner-create-task-from-buffer'.

   This command does more than just add an item to your list of tasks.
It also connects that item to some useful context information.

   If you create a task while viewing any buffer other than a Planner
day page, Planner will associate the task with a hyperlink to that
buffer. Try it now by creating a task from this Info buffer.

  1. `M-x planner-create-task-from-buffer'

  2. When prompted for the task name, enter `Learn how to change a
     task's status' and press <RET>.

  3. When prompted for the date, press <RET> to schedule the task for
     today.

  4. When prompted for the project page, press <RET> to accept the
     default page of `TaskPool'. This is a page for tasks not connected
     to a larger plan.


   Planner prompts you for two pieces of information when you ask it to
create a task. First, it asks you when you would like to have the task
show up in your planner. If you would like it to be scheduled for
today, you can just hit <RET>. If you would like it to be scheduled for
some day during the current month, you can just enter the date, without
the month, like `16'. If you would like it to be scheduled for some day
in a future month of the current year, you can enter just the month and
date, like `06.16'. If you would like to schedule something for next
year, then enter the full date, like `06.16.2005'. If you do not want
this task to appear on a day page at all, you can enter `nil'.

   The second piece of information Planner asks for is the name of the
project to associate the task with. In the above example, you
associated the task with the project "TaskPool", which means that you
did not want to associate the task with a particular project or goal in
your life. Another way to do this is to answer the project prompt by
entering `nil'. But instead, you might enter `LearnPlanner' as the
project. This creates a new page called "LearnPlanner" in your planner
directory and places an entry for the task on that page.

   The task then exists in two places: once on your day page, to show
how it fits into your daily work; and once on a project page, to show
how it fits into your larger projects and goals. In the future you might
add related tasks like, "Memorize Planner keybindings". These tasks
might be scattered over weeks or months worth of day pages, but as long
as you enter the same project name for each, you will have a way to
look at them all together on a single project page.

   Planner also creates hyperlinks to enable you to easily move back
and forth between the day page system and the project page system. Each
task on a day page will have a hyperlink to its project page. Each task
on a project page will have a hyperlink to its day page.

   After using Planner for a while, you may find yourself with quite a
few project pages. Keep in mind that completion is enabled at the
project prompt when you create a task, so hitting `SPC' or `TAB' at the
prompt will show you a list of your current project pages.

   Once the task is created, you are returned to the buffer you were
working in again, Planner gets out of your way, and you can go on about
your business. Later on, when you decide to actually work on that
"Memorize Planner keybindings" task, you will be able to follow the
hyperlink from that task on your day or project page directly to the
relevant node in the Planner info file!

   By default, `M-x planner-create-task-from-buffer' creates
medium-priority tasks, marked with the letter `B'.  But you can specify
a particular priority or change the default (*note Task Priorities::).

   You don't have to use `planner-create-task-from-buffer' to create
tasks. You can also create new tasks manually by typing them directly
on your day or project page in the format Planner expects. You can even
still create hyperlinks by using Muse formatting as you manually type
the new task. Keep in mind also that tasks do not have to be linked to
any other page.

   For convenience, `planner-create-task-from-buffer' is bound to `C-c
C-t' in Planner buffers.  You can bind `planner-create-task-buffer' to
a shortcut key.  See the manual for your Emacs distribution to find out
more about keybinding.

 -- Function: planner-create-task-from-buffer title date plan-page
     Create a new task named TITLE on DATE based on the current buffer.

     With a prefix, associate the task with the current planner page.
     If you create a task on a date page, you will be prompted for a
     plan page.  If you create a task on a plan page, you will be
     prompted for a day page.  If nil is specified, the task is created
     only on the current page.

     See `planner-create-task' for more information.

     The new task is created at the top or bottom of the first block of
     tasks on the scheduled day page (if any), depending on the value of
     `planner-add-task-at-end-flag'.

 -- Function: planner-create-task title date annotation plan-page
     Create a new task named TITLE based on the current Wiki page.  If
     DATE is non-nil, makes a daily entry on DATE, else makes an entry
     in today's planner page. It's assumed that the current Wiki page
     is the page you're using to plan an activity. Any time accrued to
     this task will be applied to that page's name in the timelog file,
     assuming you use timeclock (*note Time Intervals: (Emacs)Time
     Intervals.). If ANNOTATION is non-nil, it will be used for the
     page annotation. If PLAN-PAGE is non-nil, the task is associated
     with the given page.

     With a prefix, associate the task with the current planner page.
     If you create a task on a date page, you will be prompted for a
     plan page.  If you create a task on a plan page, you will be
     prompted for a day page.  If nil is specified, the task is created
     only on the current page.

     You probably want to call `planner-create-task-from-buffer'
     instead.

     The new task is created at the top or bottom of the first block of
     tasks on the scheduled day page (if any), depending on the value of
     `planner-add-task-at-end-flag'.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Task Priorities,  Next: Task IDs,  Prev: Creating a Task,  Up: Creating New Tasks

6.2.1.2 Task Priorities
.......................

You can set the priority of a task when you create it, rather than
waiting to adjust it after the fact. In order to do this, call the
function corresponding to the priority you want. You probably want to
bind these functions to some keys if you intend to use them much.

   * `planner-create-high-priority-task-from-buffer' creates a task
     with priority `A'.

   * `planner-create-medium-priority-task-from-buffer' creates a task
     with priority `B'.

   * `planner-create-low-priority-task-from-buffer' creates a task with
     priority `C'.

   Or, you can change the default priority of
`planner-create-task-from-buffer' by customizing
PLANNER-DEFAULT-TASK-PRIORITY.

   You can actually use just one general priority, but using more than
one color-codes your tasks and gives you a better overview of your day.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Task IDs,  Next: Cyclic Tasks,  Prev: Task Priorities,  Up: Creating New Tasks

6.2.1.3 Task IDs
................

After loading `planner.el', make sure that `planner-id.el' is in your
load path and add this to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-id)

   This module modifies the behavior of `planner.el', adding global
task IDs so that tasks can be edited and updated. Planner IDs are of
the form `{{Identifier:Number}}'.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-id-add-task-id-flag
     Non-nil means automatically add global task IDs to newly-created
     tasks. If nil, use `planner-id-add-task-id' to add IDs to existing
     tasks, or `planner-id-add-task-id-to-all' to add to all tasks on
     the current page.

 -- User Option: planner-id-update-automatically
     Non-nil means automatically update linked tasks whenever a page is
     saved. If nil, use `planner-update-task' to update the linked
     task. By default, linked tasks are automatically updated.

 -- User Option: planner-id-tracking-file
     File that contains ID tracking data. This file is automatically
     overwritten.

Functions
---------

The following interactive functions are defined in `planner-id.el':

 -- Function: planner-id-jump-to-linked-task &optional info
     Display the linked task page. If INFO is specified, follow that
     task instead.

 -- Function: planner-id-add-task
     Add a task ID for the current task if it does not have one yet.
     Update the linked task page, if any.

 -- Function: planner-id-update-tasks-on-page &optional force
     Update all tasks on this page. Completed or cancelled tasks are not
     updated. This can be added to `write-file-functions'. If FORCE is
     non-nil, completed and cancelled tasks are also updated.

 -- Function: planner-id-add-task-id-to-all
     Add a task ID for all the tasks on the page. Update the linked
     page, if any.

 -- Function: planner-id-search-id id
     Search for all occurrences of ID.

 -- Function: planner-id-follow-id-at-point
     Display a list of all pages containing the ID at point.

 -- Function: planner-id-follow-id-at-mouse event
     Display a list of all pages containing the ID at mouse. EVENT is
     the mouse event.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Cyclic Tasks,  Next: Task Detail,  Prev: Task IDs,  Up: Creating New Tasks

6.2.1.4 Cyclic Tasks
....................

If there are tasks that you have to do regularly, you can have Planner
schedule those tasks automatically.

   Make sure that `planner-cyclic.el' is in your load path and add this
to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-cyclic)

   Create a diary file named `~/.diary.cyclic-tasks' (or the value of
`planner-cyclic-diary-file'). Here is an example:

     Tuesday #B0 _ Study Japanese
     Friday #B0 _ Study Japanese (JapaneseStudies)

   The first will be a plain task, the second will be linked.  The first
line will automatically create its task every Tuesday, while the second
will create it every Friday.

   You can schedule tasks in a variety of ways. This module uses the
same syntax for specifying when tasks will be scheduled as the Emacs
diary uses for appointments and events. See *Note the GNU Emacs Manual:
(emacs)Date Formats, and *Note the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual:
(elisp)Sexp Diary Entries, for a full description of the possibilities.

   By default, planner-cyclic creates multiple tasks if you let tasks
build up (that is, the next Tuesday rolls around and you _still_ haven't
marked the task as done.) To turn off this behavior:

     (setq planner-cyclic-diary-nag nil)

Functions
---------

`planner-cyclic-diary' includes the following interactive functions:

 -- Function: planner-cyclic-create-tasks-maybe
     Maybe create cyclic tasks. This will only create tasks for future
     dates or today.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Task Detail,  Next: Deadlines,  Prev: Cyclic Tasks,  Up: Creating New Tasks

6.2.1.5 Task Detail
...................

You may find your planner pages getting very full, so that you want to
have one broad task entry be linked to a more specific list of
sub-tasks. Or, maybe you want to have a number of notes linked to a
particular task.  

   This can be done with targets.  You can have a task that is really a
meta-task:

     #A1  _ Do things in RevelleLog#13 {{Tasks:101}} (RevelleLog)

   `RevelleLog#13' could then be a list of sub-tasks in the form of a
note, or any kind of note.

   Or, instead of pointing to a particular note on `RevelleLog', you
could have the whole page be tasks that you enter in manually, without
linking them to another page. You can just type them in like this:

     #A1  _ First specific thing to do

   This way, the tasks will only appear on this specific project page,
and not on any daily page, so you only see them when you want to look
up all of the specific tasks associated with `#A1  _ Do things in
RevelleLog {{Tasks:101}} (RevelleLog)'.

   As you can see, the ability to manually enter tasks is one of
Planner's nicest features. It allows you to create tasks that are not
assigned to a specific date (by manually entering them on a project
page with no date) or to a specific project (by manually entering them
on a day page with no project). Yet as long as you enter them using the
syntax it understands, Planner will continue to recognize them as tasks.

   Another way to have a task not be connected to a particular date is
to do `C-c C-c' (`planner-copy-or-move-task') and specify `nil' when
asked for the date.

   If you would like to see a list of all of your unfinished tasks, do
`M-x planner-list-unfinished-tasks'. This function only checks day plan
pages, not project pages.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Deadlines,  Prev: Task Detail,  Up: Creating New Tasks

6.2.1.6 Deadlines
.................

You can use `planner-deadline.el' to automatically recalculate days to
a deadline by adding `(require 'planner-deadline)' to your `~/.emacs'.
With the default setup, make your tasks of the form

     #A0 _ Some task {{Deadline: 2004.09.12}}

   (Note: There must be at least one space after the colon.)

   After you run `planner-deadline-update' to update task descriptions,
the task will be of the form

     #A0 _ Some task {{Deadline: 2004.09.12 - 2 days}}

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-deadline-regexp
     Regular expression for deadline data.  The special deadline string
     should be regexp group 1. The date (YYYY.MM.DD) should be regexp
     group 2.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-deadline-update
     Replace the text for all tasks with deadlines. Deadlines are of the
     form `{{Deadline: YYYY.MM.DD}}' by default.

 -- Function: planner-deadline-change &optional date
     Change the deadline of current task to DATE. If DATE is nil,
     remove deadline.

6.2.2 Organizing Your Tasks
---------------------------

Okay, now that you've gotten the hang of creating tasks, you're probably
facing a really long list of things to do. How can you organize them so
that they don't overwhelm you? Planner gives you a number of strategies
for dealing with large numbers of tasks.

  1. Arrange your tasks in the rough order you're going to do them.

  2. Use #A, #B and #C task priorities to differentiate between
     high-priority, normal and low-priority tasks.

  3. Schedule your tasks onto different days.

  4. Group your tasks into plan pages.

  5. Don't schedule all your tasks.

  1. _Task order_

     To remind yourself to do tasks in a certain order, simply edit the
     lines so that they're in the order you want. You can use normal
     editing commands like kill, yank and transpose-line to reorder the
     tasks, or use <M-p> (`planner-raise-task') and <M-n>
     (`planner-lower-task') to rearrange the tasks.

  2. _Task priorities_

     By default, tasks are created with medium priority (`#B'). You can
     make a task high-priority (`#A') or low-priority (`#C') by
     manually editing the task and calling M-x planner-update-task to
     update the linked page. Alternatively, you can use <C-M-p>
     (`planner-raise-task-priority') and <C-M-n>
     (`planner-lower-task-priority') to modify the task and update the
     linked page.

     You can edit the priority of a task using `M-x
     planner-edit-task-priority', or manually edit it and call `M-x
     planner-update-task' to update tasks on the linked page.

  3. _Schedule your tasks on different days_

     You don't have to do everything today. Is this a task you would
     rather do tomorrow? Schedule it for then instead. You can specify
     `+n' or `-n' whenever you are asked for a date, where N is the
     number of days before or after the current file's date or today.
     Don't over-procrastinate things, though!

  4. _Plan pages_

     Plan pages let you group related tasks and notes together for easy
     reference. For example, you could have a plan page for each major
     project or goal in your life, like `GoodHealth' or
     `FurtherStudies'.

     Although plan pages start by grouping everything under a `* Tasks'
     header, you can organize your plan pages in different ways. For
     example, you can separate groups of tasks with blank lines, and
     Planner will sort tasks within each group.

  5. _Tasks without dates_

     Plan pages also allow you to have undated tasks or tasks with no
     particular deadlines. This keeps your daily task list small and
     manageable while making it easier for you to find things to do if
     you have free time. Make sure you check your plan pages regularly
     so that you don't completely forget about them.

     For automated scheduling of the next task on a plan page after you
     complete a task, see the section in
     `http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/planner-config.el' named
     "Schedule next undated task from same project".

6.2.2.1 Associating Tasks with Multiple Projects
................................................

You can use `planner-multi.el' to associate a task with more than one
project. That way, you can easily keep GTD-style context lists as well
as project-related lists.

   To use multiple projects, add the following to your `~/.emacs':

     (require 'planner-multi)

   Under GNU Emacs, you can specify multiple projects by separating them
with a single space. For example, you can specify `planner doc' when
creating a task to associate the task with those two projects.

   Under XEmacs, you can specify multiple projects by typing `RET'
after each entry and terminating the list with another `RET'. For
example, to specify `planner' and `doc', you would type `planner RET
doc RET RET' at the prompt.

   If you want to see an overview of all of your tasks as well as
project- or context-specific lists, you can set
`planner-multi-copy-tasks-to-page' to your overview page(s). For
example, set it to `TaskPool' to be able to see an overview of all of
your unfinished tasks. You can also set this to multiple pages such as
`[[TasksByProject][p]] [[TasksByContext][c]]' and use
`planner-trunk.el' to sort and organize tasks for easy reference.
(*note Grouping Tasks::)

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-multi-copy-tasks-to-page
     Automatically copy newly-created tasks to the specified page.

   By default, tasks are removed from
`planner-multi-copy-tasks-to-page' when you call `planner-task-done' or
`planner-task-cancelled'. If you prefer to keep a copy of the task,
remove `planner-multi-remove-task-from-pool' from
`planner-mark-task-hook'.

   If you want to use a different separator instead of spaces, customize
the `planner-multi-separator' variable.

 -- User Option: planner-multi-separator
     String that separates multiple page references.

     For best results, this should be something recognized by
     `muse-link-at-point' so that links are highlighted separately.

6.2.2.2 Viewing tasks
.....................

Review the tasks scheduled for today by typing `M-x
planner-goto-today'.  If you created the task from the previous section
in this tutorial, you should see a line that looks like

     #A _ Learn how to change a task's status from Tasks (TaskPool)

   If you have `planner-use-task-numbers' set to non-nil, you will see
something like the following instead.

     #A0 _ Learn how to change a task's status from Tasks (TaskPool)

   From left to right, these are what the symbols mean:

   * `A' - Priority.  A (high)

   * `0' - Priority number.  It is calculated whenever you save the file
     or call `planner-renumber-tasks', provided that
     `planner-use-task-numbers' is non-nil.  Tasks are numbered in
     ascending order according to priorities.

   * `_' - Status.  _ (unfinished)

   If you click on `Tasks' or press <RET> while your cursor is in the
link, Emacs will display the previous info page.

   If you select `TaskPool', Emacs will display the `TaskPool' plan
page.  Plan pages organize your tasks and notes about a project in one
file.

Functions
---------

You can use `planner-seek-next-unfinished-task' to move to the next
unfinished task on the current page.

 -- Function: planner-list-tasks-with-status status &optional pages
     Display all tasks that match the STATUS regular expression on all
     day pages.  The PAGES argument limits the pages to be checked in
     this manner:

        * `t': check all pages

        * regexp: search all pages whose filenames match the regexp

        * list of page names: limit to those pages

        * alist of page/filenames: limit to those pages

     Called interactively, this function will search day pages by
     default. You can specify the start and end dates or leave them as
     nil to search all days. Calling this function with an interactive
     prefix will prompt for a regular expression to limit pages.
     Specify `.' or leave this blank to include all pages.

     This function could take a long time.

 -- Function: planner-list-unfinished-tasks &optional pages
     Display all unfinished tasks. PAGES follows
     planner-list-tasks-with-status.

 -- Function: planner-jump-to-linked-task task-info
     Display the task page linked to by the current task or TASK-INFO.

6.2.2.3 Modifying Tasks
.......................

To select a task, move your cursor to the line containing the task.

   Change a task's priority (`A', `B' or `C') by editing the line. `#A'
tasks are important. `#B' are medium priority. `#C' are low priority.
Whenever you save the file or call `M-x planner-fix-tasks', tasks are
sorted and numbered according to priority and status.

   Change a task's status by calling one of the following functions:

   * planner-task-in-progress `o' (`C-c C-z')

   * planner-task-done `X' (`C-c C-x')

   * planner-task-cancelled `C' (`C-c C-S-x')

   * planner-task-delegated `D'

   * planner-task-pending `P'

   * planner-task-open `_'

   After changing the status using a function, look at the `TaskPool'
plan page.  The task is also updated on the linked page.  If you
changed the task status manually by replacing the status with another
character, you will need to call `planner-update-task' to update the
linked page.

   To reschedule a task, call `planner-copy-or-move-task' (`C-c C-c')
and choose a new date.  You can mark a region and type `M-x
planner-copy-or-move-region' to reschedule all the contained tasks to a
different date.  Enter `nil' for the date if you don't want the task or
group of tasks to appear on any date page at all anymore. This is a
good way to "de-schedule" a task for the time being, but still keep it
linked to a plan page for possible future scheduling.

   To change the plan page associated with a task, call
`planner-replan-task'.  Enter `nil' for the plan page if you don't want
the task to appear on any plan page anymore. If you precede the command
with a prefix argument, the text of the original plan page will appear
in the prompt for easy editing.

   Since the same task may exist on two or more pages, such as a date
page and a plan page, it is dangerous to edit the description of the
task by hand. You should not do it unless you want to make the exact
same changes on all its linked pages.

   Instead of doing this by hand, you should use
`planner-edit-task-description'. This will prompt you for the changes
to the task description and then update all the other pages to which
the task is linked.  Or, you can just use `planner-delete-task' to
remove the task from both pages, and then create it again with the new
desired description.

   To remind yourself to do tasks in a certain order, simply edit the
lines so that they're in the order you want.  `planner-raise-task' and
`planner-lower-task' update the priorities on linked pages
automatically. You can organize tasks into groups by putting a blank
line between groups of tasks.  Planner will maintain the groupings and
only sort the tasks within that group.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-replan-task page-name
     Change or assign the plan page for the current task.  PAGE-NAME is
     the new plan page for the task. Use `planner-copy-or-move-task' if
     you want to change the date. With a prefix, provide the current
     link text for editing.

 -- Function: planner-raise-task-priority
     Change a low-priority task to a medium-priority task and a
     medium-priority task to a high-priority task (C to B to A).

 -- Function: planner-lower-task-priority
     Change a high-priority task to a medium-priority task and a
     medium-priority task to a low-priority task (A to B to C).

 -- Function: planner-raise-task arg
     Move a task up ARG steps.  By default, ARG is 1.

 -- Function: planner-lower-task arg
     Move a task down ARG steps.  By default, ARG is 1.

 -- Function: planner-edit-task-description description
     Change the description of the current task, updating the linked
     page if any.

 -- Function: planner-delete-task
     Delete this task from the current page and the linked page.

 -- Function: planner-update-task
     Update the current task's priority and status on the linked page.
     Tasks are considered the same if they have the same description.
     This function allows you to force a task to be recreated if it
     disappeared from the associated page.

     Note that the text of the task must not change. If you want to be
     able to update the task description, see
     `planner-edit-task-description' or `planner-id.el'.

   See `planner-install-extra-task-keybindings' for additional
task-related shortcuts.

6.2.2.4 Carrying Over Unfinished Tasks
......................................

Sometimes you won't be able to cross off all the tasks on your list.
Planner makes it easy for you to keep track of things you still have to
do by automatically rescheduling unfinished tasks from the past few
days. By default, the `plan' command searches for unfinished tasks from
the last three days and reschedules them onto today. If you open
Planner every day, this should cover weekends easily.

   It's a good idea to start Planner whenever you start Emacs. That way,
Planner can help remind you about today's tasks, appointments, and other
things. To automatically start Planner whenever you start up Emacs, add
the following code to the end of your `~/.emacs':

     (plan)

   Now, every time you start Emacs (which should be more or less once a
day), you'll see today's page. If you don't finish all the tasks today,
you'll see them again tomorrow.

   It's a good idea to start Planner every time you start Emacs so that
you get reminded about your task list. If you prefer to start Planner
manually, remember to call `M-x plan' every so often to make sure that
you don't forget any unfinished tasks. Safe in the knowledge that
Planner tasks won't slip through the cracks (unlike little slips of
paper that will invariably get mislaid), you can then get on with the
rest of your life.

   If your increased productivity with Planner leads to a well-deserved
two-week vacation, then you'll need to tell Planner to search more days
for unfinished tasks. By using `M-x plan', you can automatically bring
forward tasks over a given number of days or even scan all the days
since time immemorial. `C-u 15 M-x plan' reschedules all unfinished
tasks from the last 15 days. `C-u -1 M-x plan' checks all of your past
day pages for unfinished tasks.

   Like everything else in Planner, you can adapt `M-x plan' to your
particular way of life. For example, if you find yourself starting up
Emacs and Planner every day-including weekends-because it's just so
much fun, you can set the `planner-carry-tasks-forward' to 1.  This can
make your Emacs startup marginally faster. On the other hand, if you
normally start Emacs once a week, you can set it to 7 or 8. If you're
worried about tasks dropping off your radar, you can set it to 0. You
can set the value of PLANNER-CARRY-TASKS-FORWARD either with <M-x
customize-variable RET planner-carry-tasks-forward RET>, or by putting
`(setq planner-carry-tasks-forward 3)' (replacing `3' with the value
appropriate for what you want) in your `~/.emacs' file.

   On the other hand, you might prefer to reschedule tasks yourself. If
you set `planner-carry-tasks-forward' to `nil', then `M-x plan' and
`(plan)' will bring you to the most recent page with unfinished tasks
if there is no page for today. You can then use
`planner-copy-or-move-task' and `planner-copy-or-move-region' to
reschedule tasks. This is probably more hassle than it's worth, though,
so let Planner take care of this for you.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-carry-tasks-forward
     If non-nil, carry unfinished tasks forward automatically.  If a
     positive integer, scan that number of days in the past.  If 0,
     scan all days for unfinished tasks.  If t, scan one day in the
     past (old behavior).  If nil, do not carry unfinished tasks
     forward.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: plan &optional force-days
     Start your planning for the day, carrying unfinished tasks forward.

     If FORCE-DAYS is a positive integer, search that many days in the
     past for unfinished tasks.  If FORCE-DAYS is `0' or `t', scan all
     days.  If FORCE-DAYS is `nil', use the value of
     `planner-carry-tasks-forward' instead, except t means scan only
     yesterday


 -- Function: planner-copy-or-move-task date force
     Reschedule the task for DATE. If FORCE is non-nil, the task is
     moved regardless of status. It also works for creating tasks from
     a Note. Use `planner-replan-task' if you want to change the plan
     page in order to get better completion.

 -- Function: planner-copy-or-move-region beg end date muffle-errors
     Move all tasks from BEG to END to DATE.
     `planner-copy-or-move-region' will copy or move all tasks from the
     line containing BEG to the line just before END. If MUFFLE-ERRORS
     is non-nil, no errors will be reported.

6.2.2.5 Task Numbering
......................

By default, tasks are numbered according to their position on the page.
Task numbers allow you to refer to tasks using Muse links.  For
example, the `#A1' task in `2004.08.16' can be referred to as
`2004.08.16#A1'.

   Note that task numbers change every time you re-sort and re-number
tasks with `planner-fix-tasks'.  As a result, they are only reliable for
references to past tasks.

   If you find yourself not using this functionality, you can turn off
task numbers by using the following option.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-use-task-numbers
     Non-nil means use task numbers when creating tasks.  This allows
     you to refer to past tasks if your tasks are numbered
     appropriately.  If you set this to nil, you can save space in your
     plan files.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Task Ranks,  Next: Grouping Tasks,  Prev: Task Numbering,  Up: Organizing Your Tasks

6.2.2.6 Task Ranks
..................

`planner-rank.el' models Franklin Covey's Urgency and Importance
principle. When you think about a task, there are two aspects in
consideration: Urgency and Importance. You may want to do the most
urgent things first, like answering an email, or you may want to do the
most important things first, like reading this manual. Or much better,
balance Urgency and Importance and decide what to do.

   `planner-rank.el' can help you balance.

   Urgency and Importance are both measured by scores from 0-9. The
higher the score, the more you want to do it first. 9 stands for "I
should have done this" and 0 stands for "I can forget this".

   If you are using the planner *Note Deadlines:: feature, the Urgency
score is automatically calculated from how many days are left to meet
the deadline. By default, it will score 9 if the task is overdue and 0
if the deadline is years away. Please refer to the docstring of
`planner-rank-deadline-urgency-map-list' for detail.

   The task rank is calculated from Urgency and Importance scores. As
different people balance urgency and importance differently, a number
of `planner-rank-calculate-rank-*' functions are provided. The
algorithms vary from a simple average to something like a weighted root
mean square deviation.

   The aggressive versions of these functions
(`planner-rank-calculate-rank-*-aggressive') will make sure if one of
Urgency and Importance is high, the resulting rank will be high as
well. `planner-rank-calculate-rank-weighted-*' functions weigh the
Urgency and Important scores depending on
`planner-rank-importance-vs-urgency-factor'.

   Call `planner-rank-test-algorithm' on each of the functions and
check the result tables to see which one you like most, and set it to
`planner-rank-rank-calculate-function'. Alternatively, accept the
defaults and tweak them when you get a better feel for ranking.

   Once the Rank is calculated, the *Note Task Priorities:: will be
automatically reset. If the Rank is greater than or equal to
`planner-rank-priority-A-valve', the task priority will be `A', if the
Rank is between `planner-rank-priority-A-valve' and
`planner-rank-priority-B-valve', the priority will be `B', else it will
be `C'.

   After setting the task importance and deadline, you can leave it as
is. As the deadline approaches, the task priority will automatically be
raised and the task re-colored to catch your eyes.

   If you are using `planner-sort-tasks' (see *note Making Files
Pretty::), you can set `planner-sort-tasks-key-function' to one of
`planner-sort-tasks-by-rank', `planner-sort-tasks-by-importance', and
`planner-sort-tasks-by-urgency'.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-rank-change-hook
     Functions to run after `planner-rank-change'.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-priority-A-valve
     Tasks with rank greater than or equal to this value will be set to
     priority `A'.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-priority-B-valve
     Tasks with rank greater than or equal to this value and less than
     `planner-rank-priority-A-valve' will be set to priority `B'. Tasks
     with rank less than this value will be set to priority `C'.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-deadline-urgency-map-list
     Defines how to calculate the Urgency score according to how many
     days are left to meet the deadline.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-default-importance
     Default importance value for newly added rank.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-default-urgency
     Default urgency value for newly added rank.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-importance-vs-urgency-factor
     How much do you think importance is more "important" than urgency.
     This will be used in `planner-rank-calculate-rank-weighted-*'
     functions.

 -- User Option: planner-rank-rank-calculate-function
     Define the function called to calculate rank.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-rank-change &optional importance urgency
     Set the Importance and Urgency of the current task.

 -- Function: planner-rank-update-current-task
     Recalculate rank for the current task.

 -- Function: planner-rank-update-all
     Recalculate rank for all tasks in the current page

 -- Function: planner-rank-update-all
     Recalculate rank for all tasks in the current page


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Grouping Tasks,  Prev: Task Ranks,  Up: Organizing Your Tasks

6.2.2.7 Grouping Tasks with planner-trunk.el
............................................

`planner-trunk.el' helps you automatically group tasks according to a
set of rules. It sorts and splits your tasks, adding a blank line
between groups of tasks. For example, if today's page looks like this:

     * Tasks

     #B   _ Buy milk (GroceryShopping)
     #B   _ Learn how to use planner-trunk (PlannerMode)
     #B   _ Buy a notebook (Bookstore)
     #B   _ Buy cereal (GroceryShopping)
     #B   _ Set up my own planner-trunk rules (PlannerMode)
     #B   _ Customize my stylesheet (MuseMode)
     #B   _ Go for a health checkup (BetterHealth)

then you might want to group the tasks into: planner and muse, shopping
list, and other items. If you set up the appropriate rules by
customizing `planner-trunk-rule-list', `planner-trunk.el' can
automatically rewrite that section line this:

     * Tasks

     #B   _ Learn how to use planner-trunk (PlannerMode)
     #B   _ Set up my own planner-trunk rules (PlannerMode)
     #B   _ Customize my stylesheet (MuseMode)

     #B   _ Buy milk (GroceryShopping)
     #B   _ Buy a notebook (BookstoreShopping)
     #B   _ Buy cereal (GroceryShopping)

     #B   _ Go for a health checkup

In this case, you would set `planner-trunk-rule-list' to `(("." nil
("PlannerMode\\|MuseMode" "Shopping")))'.

   You can load `planner-trunk' with `M-x load-library RET
planner-trunk RET' or add `(require 'planner-trunk)'. If you're not yet
comfortable with Emacs Lisp, you can use `M-x customize-variable RET
planner-trunk-rule-list RET' to edit this rule using an easy-to-use
interface.

   WARNING: Do not keep non-task information in the Tasks section.
planner-trunk will delete *all* non-task lines from the Tasks section
of your plan page in the process of grouping the tasks.

   After you set up `planner-trunk-rule-list', use `M-x
planner-trunk-tasks' to try out your rules until you're satistfied.

   If you want to do this automatically, you can use `(add-hook
'planner-mode-hook 'planner-trunk-tasks)' to trigger it automatically
whenever you open a Planner page.

6.2.3 Task Reports and Overviews
--------------------------------

Planner provides a number of different ways to generate different
presentations of your tasks.

* Menu:

* Accomplishments::             planner-accomplishments.el
* Status Reports::              planner-report.el
* Task Overviews::              planner-tasks-overview.el

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Accomplishments,  Next: Status Reports,  Prev: Task Reports and Overviews,  Up: Task Reports and Overviews

6.2.3.1 Generating Daily Accomplishment Reports
...............................................

You can use `planner-accomplishments.el' to get a summary of your task
activity for a particular day. The report is grouped by status and plan
(on day pages) or date (on plan pages). An example report follows:

     Link        | Unfinished | In progress | Delegated | Completed | Total
     nil         | 1          | 0           | 0         | 6         | 7
     TaskPool    | 1          | 1           | 0         | 3         | 5
     Planner     | 0          | 0           | 1         | 1         | 2
     SchoolWork  | 0          | 0           | 0         | 1         | 1
     Total       | 2          | 1           | 1         | 11        | 15

   This lets you see how you balance your time between your projects.

     There are currently two ways to use `planner-accomplishments.el'.

   * Displaying a temporary buffer

     You can call `planner-accomplishments-show' to display a buffer
     containing the current page's accomplishment report.

   * Rewriting sections of your planner

     Choose this approach if you want accomplishment reports to be in
     their own section and you would like them to be readable in your
     plain text files even outside Emacs. Caveat: The accomplishment
     section should already exist in your template and will be rewritten
     when updated.

     To use, set `planner-accomplishments-section' to the name of the
     section to rewrite (default: `Accomplishments'). If you want
     rewriting to be automatically performed, call
     `planner-accomplishments-insinuate'. The accomplishments will be
     rewritten whenever you save a planner page. If you want rewriting
     to be manual, call `planner-accomplishments-update'.


Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-accomplishments-section
     Header for the accomplishments section in a plan page.  Used by
     `planner-accomplishments-update'.

 -- User Option: planner-accomplishments-status-display
     Alist of status-label maps also defining the order of display.
     Used by `planner-accomplishments-format-table'.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-accomplishments-insinuate ()
     Automatically call `planner-accomplishments-update' when saving
     tasks in `planner-mode' buffers.

 -- Function: planner-accomplishments-update ()
     Rewrite `planner-accomplishments-section' with a summary of tasks
     on this page.

 -- Function: planner-accomplishments-show ()
     Display a buffer with the current page's accomplishment report.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Status Reports,  Next: Task Overviews,  Prev: Accomplishments,  Up: Task Reports and Overviews

6.2.3.2 Status Reports
......................

`planner-report.el' creates a status report for a given timespan.  The
report itself is just another Planner page in your planner directory.
Once generated, it contains tasks and notes culled from active project
pages.  Tasks are only shown if they are incomplete or were completed
within the timespan.  Notes are shown if they were created during the
timespan.  Tasks and notes are grouped together under a heading for
their corresponding project.

   The idea is you have one of these status reports generated
periodically (say, every couple of weeks).  Perhaps you use cron to run
them automatically and then mail you a reminder that they've been done.
Then you can edit the page, adding verbiage where it is needed and
removing irrelevant items.  This editing process is as easy as editing
any other Planner page.  Finally, you can publish the page along with
the rest of your planner using `M-x muse-project-publish'.

   If you use planner-authz.el, you can tell planner-report.el only to
consult project pages that a given list of users (PLANNER-REPORT-AUTHZ)
can access when generating the report.  For example, if you're
preparing a status report for your boss, add yourself and him to
PLANNER-REPORT-AUTHZ.  The resulting status report will only contain
information the two of you are supposed to have access to, and the
report itself will be similarly restricted.

Getting started
---------------

Add the following to your .emacs file:

     (require 'planner-report)

   Then you can use the following command to generate a status report:

     M-x planner-report-generate

   You will be prompted for a beginning and ending date, and then the
status report will be generated.  You can then edit it to your liking
and publish it just like you would the rest of your planner.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-report-authz
     List of users a status report should be restricted to.  When
     status reports are generated, only planner pages accessible by
     these users will be consulted, and the resulting status report
     will be similarly restricted.

 -- User Option: planner-report-pretty-print-plan-pages
     If non-nil, pretty print plan pages.  If nil, leave page names
     as-is.  This requires that `muse-wiki.el' be loaded to work
     properly.

 -- User Option: planner-report-remove-task-numbers
     Remove task numbers when generating status reports.

 -- User Option: planner-report-replace-note-numbers
     If non-nil, a string with which to replace note numbers when
     generating status reports.

 -- User Option: planner-report-unfinished-offset
     If non-nil, the offset in days from the current date of unfinished
     tasks to include in the status report.  If nil, include all
     unfinished tasks.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-report-generate begin end
     Generate a status report spanning a period from BEGIN to END.
     BEGIN and END are in the format YYYY.MM.DD.

6.2.3.3 Seeing an Overview of Tasks
...................................

You can see a list of tasks with `planner-tasks-overview.el'.  Seeing
how you've scheduled tasks over the next few days can help you decide
when to schedule another task. Table entries will be of the form

   DATE | LINK | PRIORITY STATUS | TASK-DESCRIPTION

Functions
---------

To display the tasks between a set of day pages, use

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview start end
     Display an overview of your tasks from START to END. If START is
     nil, start from the very first day page. If END is nil, include
     the very last day page. You can use `planner-expand-name'
     shortcuts here, like `+1' or `-1'.  Pressing <RET> at the prompt
     will use today.

     Once in a `planner-tasks-overview' buffer, you can use the
     keyboard shortcut <o> to change the overview period.

   You can sort the task display with the following functions:

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-sort-by-date
     Sort the tasks by date. Keyboard shortcut: <1>

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-sort-by-plan
     Sort the tasks by associated plan page. Keyboard shortcut: <2>

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-sort-by-priority
     Sort the tasks by priority. Keyboard shortcut: <3>

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-sort-by-status
     Sort the tasks by status. Keyboard shortcut: <4>

   You can jump to linked tasks with

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-jump other-window
     Display the current task. If a prefix argument is supplied, show
     the task in another window. Keyboard shortcut: <j>

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-jump-other-window
     Display the current task in another window. Keyboard shortcut:
     `C-u j'

   You can view a summary of the tasks in your plan pages with

 -- Function: planner-tasks-overview-show-summary &optional file-list
     Count unscheduled, scheduled, and completed tasks for FILE-LIST. If
     called with an interactive prefix, prompt for the plan page(s) to
     display. Load `planner-multi.el' to be able to specify multiple
     pages.

Keys
----

6.3 planner-registry
====================

The `planner-registry' module provides a way to keep track of all the
URLs in your projects, and to list them depending on the current
buffer.  The URLs are defined in `muse-url-protocols' module from Muse.

   If a URL has been created by `planner-create-task-from-buffer',
going to that buffer and calling `planner-registry-show' will show you
where Planner put the URL.

Getting started
---------------

To begin using `planner-registry', add the following to your Planner
configuration file.

     (require 'planner-registry)
     (planner-registry-initialize)

   You must put it after the place where Planner has been loaded in your
configuration file.

   If you want the registry to be updated each time you save a Planner
file, add the following to your Planner configuration.

     (planner-registry-insinuate)

   If you don't want to update the registry each time a file is written,
you can do it manually with `planner-registry-update': it will update
the registry for saved Planner/Muse buffers only.

   `planner-registry' does not define any keybindings by default.  Its
most useful interactive function is `planner-registry-show'.

Example usage
-------------

Say for example that you created a task from an e-mail.  Go to that
e-mail and call `planner-registry-show': it will open a new buffer
displaying the files (in a muse links format) where a link to this
e-mail has been added.

Options
-------

`planner-registry' defines the following options.

 -- User Option: planner-registry-file
     The file where `planner-registry' stores its URL registry.

 -- User Option: planner-registry-min-keyword-size
     The minimum size for keywords.

 -- User Option: planner-registry-max-keyword-size
     The maximum size for keywords.

 -- User Option: planner-registry-max-number-of-keywords
     The maximum number of keywords.

 -- User Option: planner-registry-ignore-keywords
     A list of keywords to ignore.

 -- User Option: planner-registry-show-level
     Level used by the `planner-registry-show' function.  0 means that
     this function shows only exact matches.  1 means that this
     function also shows descriptive matches.  2 (or more) means that
     this function also shows fuzzy matches.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: planner-zoom,  Prev: planner-registry,  Up: Task Reports and Overviews

6.4 planner-zoom
================

When assessing where you stand in relation to the tasks you have set
out for yourself, you might want a way to survey those tasks in groups
divided by time periods, like by the week or by the month. You could
create all of these overview pages by hand, but if you like to have
this kind of overview frequently, you might find manually creating such
pages to be tedious and time consuming.

   `planner-zoom' is an optional module designed to make it easy to
view your task information grouped by year, quarter, month, week or day.

   To install this module, just load it in your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-zoom)

   This module will recognize planner pages named according to the
following scheme:

year view
     `2006.Year'

quarter view
     `2006.Quarter2'

month view
     `2006.January'

week view
     `2006.January.Week3'

day view
     `2006.01.02'


Keybindings
-----------

This module also adds key bindings that you can use when looking at a
Planner page to easily jump between the different time-period views.

`S-up'
     Move to the view corresponding to the time period one step larger
     than the current one. For example, it moves from the weekly view
     to the monthly view. It calls `planner-zoom-iup'.

`S-down'
     Move to the view corresponding to the time period one step smaller
     than the current one. For example, it moves from the weekly view to
     the daily view. It calls `planner-zoom-idown'.

`S-left'
     Stay in the same time-period view as the current one, but move one
     interval earlier. For example, it moves from `2006.January.Week3'
     to `2006.January.Week2'. It calls `planner-zoom-iprev'.

`S-right'
     Stay in the same time-period view as the current one, but move one
     interval later. For example, it moves from `2006.January.Week3' to
     `2006.January.Week4'. It calls `planner-zoom-inext'.


Example usage
-------------

Look at the page named `2006.January' and then hit `S-down' which will
show `2006.January.Week1'. Then hit `S-left' and `S-right' to look at
`2006.January.Week2', `2006.January.Week3', etc.

Advanced tips and options
-------------------------

You can use any prefix argument with `planner-zoom-iup' and
`planner-zoom-idown' to have the new view display in a window other
than the current one. This also works with a nonnumeric prefix argument
and `planner-zoom-inext' or `planner-zoom-iprev'.  For these two
functions, a numeric prefix will specify the number of intervals to
move.

   If you don't like the default patterns for naming the time-period
view pages, you can change them by customizing `planner-zoom-regexps'.

   Some people believe weeks start with Sunday, and some believe they
start with Monday. To accommodate both of these colliding worldviews,
`planner-zoom-first-day-of-week' can be customized. Its default value
is `1', which is Monday. If you would prefer Sunday, change it to `0'.
The month to which a week belongs is the month in which the first day
of the week falls.

Command reference
-----------------

 -- Function: planner-zoom-iup name other-window
     Move to the next higher level in the hierarchy. With a prefix
     argument, show the desired page in the other window.

 -- Function: planner-zoom-idown name other-window
     Move to the next lower level in the hierarchy. If the current date
     is within the higher-level time range, zoom to the lower level
     time range that also contains today. Otherwise, just go to the
     first lower-level time range. With a prefix argument, show the
     desired page in the other window.

 -- Function: panner-zoom-inext name num other-window
     Move to the next time range at the same level in the hierarchy.
     With a numeric prefix argument, move by that number of time
     ranges. With a non-numeric prefix argument, show the desired page
     in the other window.

 -- Function: planner-zoom-iprev name num other-window
     Move to the previous time range at the same level in the hierarchy.
     With a numeric prefix argument, move by that number of time ranges.
     With a non-numeric prefix argument, show the desired page in the
     other window.

6.5 More about Notes
====================

You can put anything in this section. Notes added by
`remember-planner.el' look like this:

     .#1 Headline
     Body

   and are outlined at the `H3' level. If you want to take notes
conveniently, check out `remember-planner.el'.

   Planner by default organizes the notes on a planner page so that the
most recent note is first. Each note is numbered, with the oldest note
labeled `.#1'. If you would like to reverse this behavior, look at `C-h
v planner-reverse-chronological-notes'.

   Notes are associated with day pages, but can also be associated with
plan pages when they are created.  A linked note looks like this:

     .#1 Headline (LinkedNote#1)
     Text

   You can jump to the linked note with `planner-jump-to-linked-note'.

   Deleting a note can be dangerous, as the notes are automatically
numbered.  Removing a note could break links in other pages.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-create-note page
     Create a note to be remembered in PAGE (today if PAGE is nil).  If
     `planner-reverse-chronological-notes' is non-nil, create the note
     at the beginning of the notes section; otherwise, add it to the
     end.  Position point after the anchor.

 -- Function: planner-create-note-from-task
     Create a note based on the current task and update the current
     task to link to the note.

 -- Function: planner-renumber-notes
     Update note numbering.

 -- Function: planner-jump-to-linked-note note-info
     Display the note linked to by the current note or NOTE-INFO if
     non-nil.

 -- Function: planner-search-notes regexp limit
     Return a buffer with all the notes returned by the query for
     REGEXP.  If called with a prefix argument, prompt for LIMIT and
     search days on or after LIMIT.

   The following sections include instructions for displaying,
manipulating, and navigating your notes efficiently.

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Using Allout Mode,  Next: <notes>,  Prev: More about Notes,  Up: More about Notes

6.5.1 Using Allout Mode
-----------------------

The format of the notes in Planner works well with Allout mode, which
provides helpful commands for navigating and formatting outlines. You
can, for example, hide the bodies of all the notes on a page so you can
see just their headlines. You can also jump easily from headline to
headline, skipping over the bodies in between.

   The commands for using Allout mode vary depending on which Emacs
version you are using. In either case, type `M-x load-library <RET>
allout <RET>' to start. If you are using CVS Emacs, type `M-x
allout-mode <RET>'. If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, type
`M-x outline-mode <RET>'.

   The exact commands then available to you differ depending on your
Emacs version, but you can view the commands and their keybindings by
typing `C-h m'. In CVS Emacs, they will start with `allout-', while in
previous versions, they will start with `outline-'.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: <notes>,  Next: <past-notes>,  Prev: Using Allout Mode,  Up: More about Notes

6.5.2 <notes>
-------------

`<notes>' is replaced by a list of note headlines when the page is
published. For example, the notes tag in the following example will be
replaced by the two headlines when published. (*note Publishing::)

     <notes>

     * Notes

     .#1 This is a headline

     and this is body text

     .#2 This is another headline

     and this is more body text

   `<notes>' is useful if you want to provide a quick summary of blog
entries at the top of your page. Just add it to your
`planner-day-page-template'.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: <past-notes>,  Next: Note Indices,  Prev: <notes>,  Up: More about Notes

6.5.3 <past-notes>
------------------

`<past-notes>' is replaced by an index of note headlines.  If START is
specified, it lists notes starting from that date.  If DIRECTORY is
specified, you can index notes in another planner directory.

     All the notes I've taken in 2004:

     <past-notes start="2004.01.01" end="2004.12.31">


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Note Indices,  Prev: <past-notes>,  Up: More about Notes

6.5.4 Note Indices
------------------

Make sure that `planner-notes-index.el' is in your load path and add
this to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-notes-index)

   Then you can use tags of the form:

     <planner-notes-index page="2004.03.02">
     <planner-notes-index from="2004.03.01" to="2004.03.31">
     <planner-notes-index limit="10">
     <planner-notes-index page="PlanPage">
     <planner-notes-index-month-table month="2004.03" limit="5">
     <planner-notes-index-month-table month="2004.03">

   You can also use the following interactive functions:

   `planner-notes-index' `planner-notes-index-days'
`planner-notes-index-weeks' `planner-notes-index-months'
`planner-notes-index-years'    (wow!)

   These work based on the current date (date of current buffer, or
today).

   If a single page is specified, this page is scanned for headlines of
the form:

      .#1 Headline

   The results are presented as a bulleted list.

   If FROM and TO are specified, all date pages between them
(inclusive) are scanned. If FROM is omitted, it is assumed to be the
earliest entry.  If TO is omitted, it is assumed to be the latest entry.

   If RECENT is specified, the list includes only that many recent
headlines.  and the results are presented as a bulleted list.

   To customize presentation, you can write a function that generates
the appropriate `<planner-notes-index>' tags. You can also use
`planner-extract-note-headlines' in your own functions.

Functions
---------

The following interactive functions are defined in
`planner-notes-index.el':

 -- Function: planner-notes-index &optional from to limit
     Display a clickable notes index. If called from a Lisp program,
     display only dates between FROM and TO. With a prefix arg LIMIT,
     display only that number of entries.

 -- Function: planner-notes-index-days days
     Display an index of notes posted over the past few DAYS. The list
     ends with the day of the current buffer or `planner-today'.

 -- Function: planner-notes-index-weeks weeks
     Display an index of notes posted over the past few WEEKS. The list
     ends with the week of the current buffer or `planner-today'. Weeks
     start from Sunday.

 -- Function: planner-notes-index-months months
     Display an index of notes posted over the past few MONTHS. The
     list ends with the month of the current buffer or `planner-today'.

 -- Function: planner-notes-index-years years
     Display an index of notes posted over the past few YEARS. The
     current year is included.

   `planner-notes-index.el' does not define any keybindings.

6.6 Making Files Pretty
=======================

By default, planner does a little bit of fancy reformatting when you
save a file. Tasks are sorted by priority (ABC) and status (_oP>XC) on
day pages. On plan pages, tasks are sorted by priority (ABC), status
(XC), and date. Undated tasks are sorted after dated tasks.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-sort-tasks-key-function
     Control task sorting. Some options include
     `planner-sort-tasks-default-key', `planner-sort-tasks-basic',
     `planner-sort-tasks-by-date', and `planner-sort-tasks-by-link'.

 -- User Option: planner-sort-undated-tasks-equivalent
     This option controls the behavior of task sorting on plan pages.
     By default, the value `9999.99.99' causes dated tasks to be listed
     before undated tasks.  To sort undated tasks before dated tasks,
     set this to a blank string.

 -- User Option: planner-sort-tasks-automatically
     Non-nil means sort tasks whenever a planner file is saved.  On day
     pages, tasks are sorted by status.  On plan pages, they are sorted
     by status and date.  Sorting can take a while.

 -- User Option: planner-renumber-tasks-automatically
     Non-nil means renumber tasks from 1 to N whenever a planner file is
     saved. This allows you to refer to tasks in previous day pages
     using anchors like `2003.08.12#A1'. If you use this function, make
     sure `planner-use-task-numbers' is non-nil so that new tasks are
     created with task numbers.

 -- User Option: planner-align-tasks-automatically
     Non-nil means align tasks whenever a planner file is saved.  This
     causes the status to line up in a neat column if you have less than
     100 tasks.

 -- User Option: planner-renumber-notes-automatically
     Non-nil means renumber the notes. If most of your notes are only on
     one page, you might like seeing the notes renumbered if you delete
     a note in the middle. However, if you use a lot of
     cross-referencing, note renumbering will break those links.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-sort-tasks
     Sort tasks according to planner-sort-tasks-key-function. By
     default, sort tasks according to priority and position on day
     pages, and according to status, priority, date, and position on
     plan pages.

 -- Function: planner-renumber-tasks
     Update task numbering.

 -- Function: planner-align-tasks
     Align tasks neatly. You can add this to `write-file-functions' to
     have the tasks automatically lined up whenever you save.  For best
     results, ensure `planner-align-tasks' is run after
     `planner-renumber-tasks'.

 -- Function: planner-fix-tasks
     Sort, renumber and align tasks.

6.7 Annotations
===============

The context included when you create a task and the context included
when you create a note are gained the same way. It sounds like black
magic, but it turns out not to be.

   All that happens is, Planner has a list of functions,
`planner-annotation-functions'. When you create a task from a buffer,
or remember a note from a buffer, Planner goes through this list from
top to bottom. The first one that returns true is the one it uses.

   For example, if you're in Wanderlust, and you hit the key you've
bound to `planner-create-task-from-buffer', it looks at this list and
does something like this.  Is it an ERC buffer? No. Is it a BBDB
buffer? No. Are we in w3m? No. Are we in Wanderlust? Yes. So this
function succeeds. It stops searching and runs the annotation function
for Wanderlust, which in this case finds out who the message is from
and what the message ID of the message is. It then takes those and
constructs a link back to that message, with a link title something
like `Email from Joe Blogs'.

   So, you've read the email from Joe Blogs. He's asked you to do
something and you've hit your key to add that task to your list of
things to do. So what you end up with is a description of the task, and
a link back to what made you create the task in the first place.

   The same happens with remembering notes, except that it ends up in
the `* Notes' section of your page instead.

   By default, `planner.el' can annotate tasks and notes based on the
current filename.

Options
-------

To change the behavior of annotations, customize the following options:

 -- User Option: planner-annotation-functions
     A list of functions tried in order by
     `planner-create-task-from-buffer' and other functions that pick up
     context.  The first non-nil value returned is used as the
     annotation.  To cause an item to *not* be annotated, return the
     empty string `""'.

 -- User Option: planner-annotation-strip-directory
     File links are usually generated with the full path to the file so
     that you can easily tell apart files with the same base name.  If
     `planner-annotation-strip-directory' is non-nil, though, only the
     base name of the file will be displayed.  For example, a link to
     `/foo/bar/baz' will be displayed as `baz' and hyperlinked to the
     file.

 -- User Option: planner-annotation-use-relative-file
     If t, always use relative filenames.
     `planner-annotation-use-relative-file' can also be a function that
     takes the filename and returns non-nil if the link should be
     relative.  Filenames are resolved relative to the first directory
     of your Planner project in `muse-project-alist'.  That is, the
     created link will be of the form `../../somefile' instead of
     `/absolute/path/to/file'.  This can be helpful if you publish your
     planner files to the Net and your directory structure ensures that
     relative links resolve the same from your Plan pages and their
     respective publishing directory.

6.8 Interactive Lisp with planner-lisp.el
=========================================

You can include interactive Lisp functions in your planner pages.

   First, you need `planner-lisp.el'. Put this in your `.emacs' (or
`_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-lisp)

   Then, add a link to the Lisp function to your page, like:


     [[lisp:/plan][Plan]]

   This will be rendered as `Plan'. Selecting the link will run the
`plan' function interactively.

   You can also execute other Lisp expressions. For example:

     [[lisp:/(planner-goto (planner-expand-name "+7"))][Next week]]

   `planner-lisp.el' does not provide any interactive functions or
keybindings.

6.9 Publishing
==============

You can publish your planner files to HTML and put them on a normal web
server-no special server support required. This gives you an easy way
to keep other people up to date on your tasks, keep a web log, or
simply organize information.

   Publish your planner wiki with `C-c C-p' (`muse-project-publish').
You can publish individual files with `C-c C-t'
(`muse-publish-this-file'). To automatically publish files when you
save them, add the following code to your `~/.emacs':

     (eval-after-load "muse-mode"
       (add-hook 'after-save-hook
                 #'(lambda ()
                     (when (planner-derived-mode-p 'muse-mode)
                       (muse-project-publish nil)))
                 nil t))

   Published files are stored in the path specified by
`muse-project-alist' for your Planner project.  Just copy the contents
of this directory to your webserver, and you're all set! Of course,
publishing is completely optional.

   Here are some more features related to publishing:

6.9.1 Publishing Planner pages
------------------------------

The task of publishing Planner pages is handled by
`planner-publish.el'.  It is loaded by default when Planner is loaded.
To publish an entire Planner project, set up `muse-project-alist'
(*note Creating Your Planner::) and hit `C-c C-p'.  To publish an
individual page, hit `C-c C-t'.

   Publishing works by providing Muse with the settings and environment
for Planner publishing.

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Publishing Calendars,  Next: Authz Access Restriction,  Prev: Publishing Planner pages,  Up: Publishing

6.9.2 Publishing Calendars
--------------------------

To publish calendars in your day pages, it is necessary to do two steps.

   * Add `(require 'planner-calendar)' to your configuration.

   * Add a `<calendar>' tag to either your header, footer, or
     PLANNER-DAY-PAGE-TEMPLATE, depending on where you want it to
     appear.

   To display a calendar based on a different day (given here as
DAYPAGE), use `<calendar page="DAYPAGE">'.

   To get arrows to previous and next months to show up, use `<calendar
arrows="t">'.  The text in PLANNER-CALENDAR-PREV-MONTH-BUTTON and
PLANNER-CALENDAR-NEXT-MONTH-BUTTON will be used for the arrows to the
previous and next months, respectively.

   By default, Muse will not display the arrows properly, due to
limitations in the special-escaping algorithm.  To work around this,

6.9.3 Authz Access Restriction
------------------------------

`planner-authz.el' was written by Andrew J. Korty in order to allow the
easy restriction of portions of published pages.  It uses the
HTML::Mason module available on CPAN (`http://www.cpan.org').  Setting
up HTML::Mason is outside the scope of this document.  Make sure that
it works before trying out `planner-authz.el'.

   `planner-authz.el' modifies the behavior of `muse-project-publish'
so that published pages follow access modifiers.

   This library lets you publish your planner pages while controlling
access to certain portions of them to users you specify.  When you load
this library, you gain access to two additional markup directives to
use in your planner pages.  The `<authz>' tag lets you restrict access
to arbitrary content as follows:

     Here is a sentence everyone should see.  This sentence also
     contains no sensitive data whatsoever.  <authz users="ajk">This
     sentence, however, talks about my predilection for that French
     vanilla instant coffee that comes in the little tin, and I'm
     embarrassed for anyone else to know about that.</authz> And
     here's some more perfectly innocuous content.

   You can use `<authz>' tags to mark up entire paragraphs, tasks,
notes, and anything else.  The tags are replaced with Mason code in the
published pages.

   The `#authz' directive restricts access to an entire page.  A Mason
call is added to this page to generate a 403 error when someone not
listed tries to access it.  Any notes or tasks on a `#authz'-protected
page are also wrapped in Mason code on linked pages. To add a `#authz'
directive to a Muse page, place `#authz' followed by a space-delimited
list of users on one line. For example:

     #authz ajk sacha

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-authz-project-default
     Default access list for project pages (not day pages).  If a given
     project page doesn't contain a `#authz' tag, it will receive the
     access list defined here.  If this variable is nil, all users will
     be allowed to view the page.  No corresponding variable is
     provided for day pages because it doesn't seem like you'd ever
     want to control access based on what day it was.  (But I will
     accept patches. :) Notes and tasks referencing pages without
     `#authz' tags will also be restricted to the users listed here.

 -- User Option: planner-authz-day-note-default
     Default access list for notes on day pages not associated with any
     project.  There is way to set a default for notes on project pages
     for the reason above; they would only be associated with date
     pages anyway.

 -- User Option: planner-authz-day-task-default
     Same as `planner-authz-day-note-default', but for tasks.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-authz-publish-index
     Publish an index for the planner marked up with Mason code.  Only
     those links to pages which the remote user is authorized to access
     will be shown.

6.9.4 RSS Publication
---------------------

`planner-rss.el' allows you to publish your notes in the RSS 2.0 XML
format for blog syndication. You will also want to customize the
following variables:

   To manually add the current note to all the matching RSS feeds,
invoke `planner-rss-add-note'. You can specify a filename with the
universal prefix, like this: `C-u M-x planner-rss-add-note'.

   If you use the `remember-planner.el' module to create notes, you can
automatically publish new notes to RSS feeds by adding the following
code to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs').

     (add-to-list 'remember-planner-append-hook 'planner-rss-add-note t)

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-rss-base-url
     Base absolute URL for published blog entries. Should include
     trailing `/'.

 -- User Option: planner-rss-category-feeds
     Rules for automatic categorization of posts and publishing to RSS
     files. A blog entry is matched against each condition. If it
     matches the regular expression or the function returns a non-nil
     value, the blog entry is copied into the specified file.

 -- User Option: planner-rss-feed-limits
     A list of regular expressions that match feed filenames and the
     size and item limits for feeds that match. For example, you can use
     `(("." nil 10))' to ensure that all feeds are limited to the 10
     most recent items.

Functions
---------

`planner-rss.el' defines the following interactive functions:

 -- Function: planner-rss-add-note FEED
     Export the current note using `planner-add-item'. If FEED is
     specified, add the entry to the specified file. Else, add the entry
     to all matching RSS feeds specified by
     `planner-rss-category-feeds'.

6.9.5 iCal Publication
----------------------

iCal is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard for
calendaring and scheduling. `http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt'

   You can export your tasks to the iCal format using `planner-ical'.
Add `(require 'planner-ical)' to your `~/.emacs'. Then you can use `M-x
planner-ical-export-page' to display the iCal equivalent of tasks on a
page, which you can then save to a file.

   To export today's tasks to a file in your publishing directory, add
the following to your `~/.emacs'.

     (planner-ical-export-file
      (planner-today)
      (expand-file-name
        "tasks.ics"
        (muse-style-element :path (car (cddr (muse-project planner-project))))))

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-ical-export-page page &optional file
     Export PAGE's tasks in the iCal format.  If FILE is non-nil,
     results are saved to that file.  If FILE is nil, results are
     displayed in a `planner-ical-export-buffer'.

 -- Function: planner-ical-export-this-page
     Display the tasks on the current page in iCal format.

6.9.6.1 Publishing with planner-rdf
...................................

Planner-rdf is now included in the normal Planner publishing process.
Pressing <C-p> will create a .owl and a .rdf file for every planner
file. Additionally it creates an index, `index.rdf'.

   By default all generated files will be stored in the normal Planner
publishing directory, where the HTML files end up. If you would ike to
change that, set the variable `planner-rdf-directory' to the desired
location.

   The generated files:

   * `index.rdf' - a collection with pointers to the `<plan-page>.rdf'
     files.

   * `<plan-page>.rdf' - contains Dublin Core metadata about the files
     related to the current Planner page. Currently it contains metadata
     about the source file, the Emacs plan page, the generated HTML
     page, and the generated OWL file.

   * `<plan-page>.owl' - contains task and note data from the Planner
     file. Task information is stored completely. For notes, the note
     headline is stored.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: planner-rdf Tags,  Next: planner-rdf Usage Examples,  Prev: Publishing with planner-rdf,  Up: RDF Publication

6.9.6.2 planner-rdf Tags
........................

Besides the factual information, e.g. the task status or description,
planner-rdf extracts links (in the format `[[...][...]]' or `[[...]]')
and tags (`{{...:...'}}) from tasks and notes (including the notes
text). Links and tags provide context for the plan elements and so are
stored and linked with the containing elements.

   Links point to locations that can be used to enrich the information
in the Planner pages (e.g, by retrieving data from them and adding it),
tags - like the one for the task ids `{{Tasks:198}}' - can be used to
express abstract qualities. Some examples:

   * an `{{audience:myteam}}' tag, can be used to restrict publishing
     of items to a certain user group;

   * a `{{lang:de}}' tag, signifying the language of the text;

   * a `{{location:Hamburg}}' tag, can be used to make geographic
     reference to an entity that is not stored in your address book,
     bbdb.

   What tags to use is up to the user. Planner-rdf makes no assumptions
about them, it just extracts and stores them. Only the applications
using the data know what to do with them.

6.9.6.3 Usage Examples
......................

Report generation with OpenOffice

   The Perl file `this-week.pl'
(`http://www.rainervolz.de/planner-rdf/this-week.pl') creates a simple
report for the current week. The script extracts task and note
information from the generated OWL files and inserts it into a simple
OpenOffice Writer document. Nothing fancy, just a proof of concept, to
show how planner-rdf can be used to integrate Planner Mode with other
applications.

   Besides Perl and OpenOffice you'll need the Redland RDF Application
Framework (`http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/'). It is used to
process the RDF data. Redland is small, but powerful, and available for
many platforms and languages.

   As an example the application loads the RDF data each time it is run.
In the real world you probably would use Redland to store the Planner
data in a database, to save the loading step each time you access the
data.

   Importing Planner data into Protege

   Protege is a popular ontology editor and knowledge management
application. A simple way to import data into it, is to provide a OWL
file that contains the data as well as the schema. To do this:

   * Use `planner2protege.pl'
     (`http://www.rainervolz.de/planner-rdf/planner2protege.pl') to
     combine all OWL files into a single one.

   * Use CWM (`http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html') to combine
     schema and data, with `python cmw --rdf planner-rdf.owl
     planner-data.owl --think --rdf >planner2.owl'

   Not the most straightforward process, but it works. The resulting
file, here planner2.owl, can then be loaded into Protege.

Planner can work together with several different Emacs e-mail clients.
If you load the appropriate module for the e-mail client you use, then
your notes and tasks can be annotated with information pointing to the
specific e-mail message you were reading when you created that note or
task. When you are looking at the note or task, you will be able to
jump straight to that message.

this module, make sure that `planner-unix-mail.el' is in your load path
and add this to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-unix-mail)

   Unix mail URLs are of the form:

     ;; mail://PATH/TO/INBOX/message-id

   Annotations will be of the form:

     [[mail://PATH/TO/INBOX/E1AyTpt-0000JR-LU%40sacha.ateneo.edu][E-mail from Sacha Chua]]

----------

To use this module, make sure that it is in your load path and put this
in your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-gnus)
     (planner-gnus-insinuate)

   With this module loaded, when you create tasks from Gnus summary or
message buffers, the tasks will be annotated with information from the
message you were looking at when you created each task. A link will also
be created on your planner page that you can select in order to return
to the message.

   So, the created task will look something like this:

     #A34 _ Send writing to publishme.com from

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Diary,  Next: Appointments,  Prev: Scheduling and Time,  Up: Scheduling and Time

7.2.1 Diary
-----------

If you use Emacs's diary feature, Planner-Diary could be helpful for
you. It puts all diary entries for the current day in the `* Diary'
section of your day plan page. This section is updated every time you
display the file in Emacs. By default the diary section of past pages
is not updated; it's pretty unlikely that you want to add new diary
entries for the past. (*note Diary: (Emacs)Diary.)

   If you want to use `planner-diary.el', make sure the file is in your
load path and add this to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (require 'planner-diary)

   `planner-diary.el' needs `fancy-diary-display'.  To use
`fancy-diary-display', add this to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (add-hook 'diary-display-hook 'fancy-diary-display)

   You can use Planner-Diary in two different ways:

  1. If you want the saved files to contain your entries and not just a
     line of Lisp, add the following lines to your `.emacs' (or
     `_emacs'):

          (setq planner-diary-use-diary t)
          (planner-diary-insinuate)

     You should also customize or set `planner-day-page-template' to
     include a `* Diary':

          (setq planner-day-page-template
           "* Tasks\n\n\n* Schedule\n\n\n* Diary\n\n\n* Notes")

  2. (GNU EMACS ONLY) You can put the following line of Lisp code in
     your day plan pages to display your diary entries:

          <lisp>(planner-diary-entries-here)</lisp>

     You can do this automatically for all day plan pages:

          (setq planner-day-page-template
            "* Tasks\n\n\n* Diary\n\n<lisp>(planner-diary-entries-here)</lisp>
          \n* Notes")

     When you open a day plan page outside Emacs, you will see the line
     of Lisp code and not your diary entries.


   If you want to see your diary entries for more than just one day, set
`planner-diary-number-of-days' accordingly.  This works for either of
the two approaches.

   `C-c C-e' updates the diary sections.  `C-u C-c C-e' forces an
update--it inserts the diary section for the day, even if the day is in
the past or if there is no `Diary' section in the buffer.

   If you want to use the Cal-Desk package, simply follow the
instructions in `cal-desk.el'.  If you get the Cal-Desk layout from the
Calendar buffer, you get it in the day plan buffer, too.

   If you use Planner-Diary, you might consider using the Calendar
support of Planner. (*note Calendar/Diary: (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.) To
get Calendar integration, add this to your `.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (planner-insinuate-calendar)

   If `planner-diary-create-section-flag' is non-nil, sections are
always inserted if necessary.

   If you want to import Planner entries into your Diary file, the
`planner2diary.py' script will accomplish this for you.  To use it,
execute `planner2diary.py' on the command line, specifying your planner
directory as the first and only argument.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-diary-create-section-flag
     Non-nil means create the requested diary sections if they do not
     exist. By default, planner-diary tries to create the section. If
     you want more control over your pages, you can set this to nil.
     Trying to write a diary section to a page that does not have it
     yet will then result in an error.

   By default, planner-diary lists only the appointments you have on
that day. If you want the date headers included even when showing the
diary entries for a single day, set planner-diary-include-all-output to
non-nil.

 -- User Option: planner-diary-include-all-output-flag
     Non-nil means don't omit any data when copying diary entries into
     day pages.

Functions
---------

`planner-diary.el' defines the following interactive functions:

 -- Function: planner-diary-add-entry date time text
     Prompt for a diary entry to add to `diary-file' on DATE.  Uses
     `planner-annotation-functions' to make hyperlinks.  TIME and TEXT
     are used in the description."

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-diary force
     Insert the fancy diary for the day into the day plan file. If
     FORCE is non-nil, insert a diary section even if there is no
     PLANNER-DIARY-STRING in the buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-diary-maybe force
     Maybe insert the fancy diary for the day into the day plan file.
     If the current day is in the past and FORCE is nil, don't do
     anything. If FORCE is non-nil, insert a diary section even if
     there is no `planner-diary-string' in the buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-appts force
     Insert the diary appointments for the day into the day plan file.
     If FORCE is non-nil, insert a diary appointments section even if
     there is no `planner-diary-appts-string' in the buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-appts-maybe force
     Maybe insert the diary appointments for the day into the day plan
     file.  If the current day is in the past and FORCE is nil, don't do
     anything.  If FORCE is non-nil, insert a diary appointments
     section even if there is no `planner-diary-appts-string' in the
     buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-cal-desk force
     Insert the cal-desk diary for the day into the day plan file.  If
     FORCE is non-nil, insert a cal-desk diary section even if there is
     no `planner-diary-cal-desk-string' in the buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-cal-desk-maybe force
     Maybe insert the cal-desk diary for the day into the day plan
     file.  If the current day is in the past and FORCE is nil, don't do
     anything.  If FORCE is non-nil, insert a cal-desk appointments
     section even if there is no `planner-diary-cal-desk-string' in the
     buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-public force
     Insert the public diary for the day into the day plan file.  If
     FORCE is non-nil, insert a public diary section even if there is
     no `planner-diary-public-string' in the buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-public-maybe force
     Maybe insert the public diary for the day into the day plan file.
     If the current day is in the past and FORCE is nil, don't do
     anything.  If FORCE is non-nil, insert a public appointments
     section even if there is no `planner-diary-public-string' in the
     buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-private force
     Insert the private diary for the day into the day plan file.  If
     FORCE is non-nil, insert a private diary section even if there is
     no `planner-diary-private-string' in the buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-private-maybe force
     Maybe insert the private diary for the day into the day plan file.
     If the current day is in the past and FORCE is nil, don't do
     anything.  If FORCE is non-nil, insert a private appointments
     section even if there is no `planner-diary-private-string' in the
     buffer.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-all-diaries force
     Update all diary sections in a day plan file.  If FORCE is
     non-nil, insert a diary section even if there is no section
     header.  It only inserts diaries if the corresponding
     `planner-diary-use-'* variable is `t'.

 -- Function: planner-diary-insert-all-diaries-maybe force
     Update all diary sections in a day plan file.  If the current day
     is in the past and FORCE is nil, don't do anything.  If FORCE is
     non-nil, insert a diary section even if there is no section
     header.  It only inserts diaries if the corresponding
     `planner-diary-use-'* variable is `t'.

 -- Function: planner-diary-show-day-plan-or-diary
     Show the day plan or diary entries for the date under point in
     calendar.  Add this to `calendar-move-hook' if you want to use it.
     In that case, you should also `remove-hook'
     `planner-calendar-show' from `calendar-move-hook'.

7.2.1.1 Planner-Diary Advanced Features
.......................................

The features described here are part of the development version.  They
are subject to change without notice.  They may be buggy.  The
documentation may be inaccurate.  Use at your own risk.

   There is a lot of code redundancy in the development version.  This
is intentional and makes it easier to change the code for one type of
diary section without breaking others.

Diary views
-----------

Currently Planner-Diary supports six different views of your diary
entries:

  1. Ordinary fancy diary display (what you get by pressing `d' in the
     calendar buffer with `fancy-diary-display' switched on)

  2. Schedule/Appointments (all entries from 1 that have a time
     assigned to them

  3. Diary without appts (1 without 2)

  4. cal-desk display (appts on top, non appts entries at bottom)

  5. A private diary (same as 1, but uses a different diary-file)

  6. A public diary (same as 1, but uses a different diary-file)

   Put the following line of Lisp code in your day plan pages to display
your diary entries:

     <lisp>(planner-diary-entries-here)</lisp>

   The function `planner-diary-entries-here' takes two optional
arguments--the diary file you want to use and the number of days you
want to display.

Exporting Planner-specific Diary files
--------------------------------------

If you would like to export diary entries from your Planner pages to
separate Diary files, add `(require 'planner-export-diary)' to your
config.  The following steps describe the usage of the functions and
options contained in this file.

  1. Customize `planner-export-diary-file'.  The default value is
     "~/diary.planner".

  2. Add the following line to your main Diary file (default:
     "~/diary").

          #include ~/diary.planner

  3. Then, call `M-x planner-export-diary-future' whenever you want
     future diary entries published. You can automatically publish
     entries by adding either of the following to your .emacs.

        * (planner-export-diary-future) Publish future entries on
          startup.

        * (add-hook 'planner-mode-hook 'planner-export-diary-setup)
          Publish future entries whenever you save a Planner file.

7.2.2 Appointments
------------------

If you would like to use planner for your appointment alerts instead of
using the diary system, you might like to try `planner-appt'.

   According to your preferences, you may choose from two different
approaches. Appointments in task descriptions on today's plan page are
like this:

     #A   _ @12:45 Do something (TaskPool)

and appointments in today's schedule section are like this:

     * Schedule

       9:00 | 12:00 | Read Simmel's Philosophy of Money
     @12:45 |       | Do Something Else
     @13:00 | 14:00 | lunch

You can even use both at the same time if you like.

Usage
.....

In the file where you configure Planner, add one of the following.

   * For task-based appointments: `(planner-appt-use-tasks)'

   * For schedule-based appointments: `(planner-appt-use-schedule)'

   * For both task- and schedule-based appointments:
     `(planner-appt-use-tasks-and-schedule)'

And finally if you want everything to be updated automatically add:

     (planner-appt-insinuate)

   If you don't want to do the insinuation then you can call:

     M-x planner-appt-update

after editing appointments on the page (note that this is not necessary
if you use tasks for the appointments and you don't edit the task
descriptions outside of `planner-edit-task-description').

   Try both methods; if you find that you prefer one over the other,
use one of the specific `planner-appt-use-' functions, as there are
some performance gains when using one method exclusively.

7.2.2.1 Task-based Appointments
...............................

A task has an appointment if it looks like this:

     #A   _ @12:45 Do something (TaskPool)

i.e., if it has @ followed by a time at the beginning.  This means the
task is a regular appointment, and will not be carried forward at the
start of a new day.

   Alternatively, it may have a !, like this:

     #A   _ !12:45 Do something else (TaskPool)

This makes it a "nagging" appointment, which _will_ be carried forward.
It will, however, lose the appointment time in the process.

   This may seem like a strange feature, but here is Henrik's reasoning:

     Sometimes I have a task that I want to do at a certain time, so I
     make it an appointment.  If I don't get around to doing it anyway,
     I want it to be carried forward.  Basically, I sometimes use
     appointments on tasks to annoy me until I get them done. :)

   You can edit, move and delete tasks with the usual functions, and
appointments will be updated automatically.

   You can update all task appointments on your page with

     M-x planner-appt-update

Cyclic Entries
..............

If you have `planner-cyclic' (*note Cyclic Tasks::) loaded, entries in
your cyclical tasks file such as

     Friday #A _ @12:45 staff meeting

will appear every Friday and there will be an appointment alert set up.

Appointments Section
....................

You can have all task-based appointments copied to a separate section,
providing an overview of your appointments.

   To do this, add

     (setq planner-appt-task-use-appointments-section-flag t)

to your configuration, or use `M-x customize-variable'.

   The variable `planner-appt-task-appointments-section' is the name of
the section where the appointments will be copied.  By default, it is
set to `"Schedule"', which means that task appointments will be
intermingled with schedule entries.

   It is also a good idea to add the section you wish to use to
`planner-day-page-template' in order to control where that section will
appear on the page (otherwise it will appear at the top).

   The format of the appointments follows that of a schedule; if you
don't like the way it looks, you can write something different and set
`planner-appt-format-appt-section-line-function' appropriately.  See
the documentation for `planner-appt-format-appt-section-line-function'
for details.  It should be fairly easy to see what needs to be done if
you look at the source for the default function (which is
`planner-appt-format-appt-section-line').

   If the section specified in `planner-appt-task-appointments-section'
is the same as the schedule section specified in
`planner-appt-schedule-section' (by default `"Schedule"'), the default
formatting function adds a `#' to the description so that one can
visually distinguish appointments from the task list from those that
have been added to the schedule.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Schedule-based Appointments,  Next: Viewing Appointments,  Prev: Task-based Appointments,  Up: Appointments

7.2.2.2 Schedule-Based Appointments
...................................

Some scheduled tasks require reminders, others don't.  In this schedule:

     * Schedule

     9:00   | 12:00 | Read Simmel's Philosophy of Money
     @12:45          Do Something Else
     @13:00 | 14:00 | lunch
     @14:30 |       | Meet jrs to discuss his dissertation
     @16:00           Test Society seminar
     18:00            go home

those that have an @ prefix will be added to the appointment reminder
list; the others will not.  The formats that are recognized are fairly
flexible, as you can see from the example.

   If you change your schedule, you can update the appointment list with

     M-x planner-appt-update

You can also have the schedule sorted as part of the update, if you
have this in your configuration:

     (setq planner-appt-sort-schedule-on-update-flag t)

Cyclical Entries
................

You can also have cyclical schedule entries(*note Cyclic Tasks::) if you
add

     (planner-appt-schedule-cyclic-insinuate)

to your configuration.

   If you put an entry in your cyclical task file like this

     Friday @12:45 | 13:45 | Staff Meeting

then it will appear in your schedule every Friday, and an appointment
alert will be set up.

7.2.2.3 Viewing Appointments
............................

The command `planner-appt-show-alerts' will show all appointment alerts
currently scheduled.

Functions
---------

There are two commands that show appointments in the future; the one
displays them in a pop-up buffer, the other puts the information into
the current day page.

 -- Command: planner-appt-forthcoming-display &optional days
     Display a buffer of appointments for today and the next DAYS.
     Optional prefix argument DAYS is the number of days ahead to look.
     Its default value is defined by `planner-appt-forthcoming-days'.

 -- Command: planner-appt-forthcoming-update-section &optional days
     In today's plan page, add or update a list of forthcoming
     appointments. Optional prefix argument DAYS is the number of days
     ahead to look. Its default value is defined by
     `planner-appt-forthcoming-days'.  The section heading to use is
     defined by `planner-appt-forthcoming-appt-section'.

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-appt-forthcoming-days
     The number of days to look ahead for forthcoming appointments.  The
     default value is seven days.

 -- User Option: planner-appt-forthcoming-appt-section
     The name of the section to use for inserting a list of forthcoming
     appts.  The default value is `"Forthcoming Appointments"'.

 -- User Option: planner-appt-forthcoming-show-day-names-flag
     When non-nil (the default), day names will be shown in forthcoming
     appointments.

 -- User Option: planner-appt-forthcoming-repeat-date-string
     String to insert for repeated dates.

     When there are multiple appointments for a date, the date is
     inserted in the first appointment and the others have this string
     in their date cell.

     If the string consists of anything other than whitespace, then a
     link to the day page for the appoinment is created.

 -- User Option: planner-appt-forthcoming-look-at-cyclic-flag
     When non-nil, find forthcoming appointments in the cyclic diary
     file (*note Cyclic Tasks::) as well as in plan pages. Default is
     `t'.

7.2.2.4 Appointment Updating on Save
....................................

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-appt-update-appts-on-save-flag
     When non-nil, update appointment reminders whenever today's plan
     page is saved. Default value is `nil'.

7.2.2.5 Appointment and Calendar Integration
............................................

Not strictly part of appointment handling, but if one isn't using the
diary, marking dates with plan pages seems to make sense.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-appt-calendar-insinuate
     Add a hook to diary display so that dates in the calendar that
     have day pages are highlighted


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Appointment Hooks,  Prev: Appointment and Calendar Integration,  Up: Appointments

7.2.2.6 Appointment Hooks
.........................

Options
-------

 -- Hook: planner-appt-update-hook
     Hook run after `planner-appt-update' has updated the appointment
     list.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Timeclock,  Next: schedule.el,  Prev: Appointments,  Up: Scheduling and Time

7.2.3 Timeclock
---------------

This module allows you to clock in and clock out of your projects
(*note Time Intervals: (Emacs)Time Intervals.). You can also generate
reports with the `<timeclock-report>' tag. You may want to read the
*Note Keeping Track of Time:: page to see how you can use
planner-timeclock to produce detailed reports.

   `timeclock.el' is part of GNU Emacs.  If you are using XEmacs,
please use the version of `timeclock.el' the comes with Planner in the
`contrib' directory.

   With `planner-timeclock.el' loaded, `planner-task-in-progress'
clocks in a task.  To clock out, use `planner-task-done' or
`timeclock-out'.

   `planner-timeclock.el' defines the following keybindings:

   * `C-c C-i': `planner-task-in-progress'.

   * `C-c C-o': `timeclock-out'.

   * `C-c C-T C-i': `planner-timeclock-in'. (XEmacs)

   * `C-c C-T C-o': `timeclock-out'. (XEmacs)

   * `C-c C-S-t C-i': `planner-timeclock-in'. (GNU Emacs)

   * `C-c C-S-t C-o': `timeclock-out'. (GNU Emacs)

   If you use `timeclock' a lot, you may also be interested in Dryice
Liu's `planner-timeclock-summary.el', which produces timeclock reports
for planner files.

   Here is a sample report:

     Project               |     Time| Ratio| Task
     PlannerMaintenance    |  0:03:58|  1.1%| Merge doc patch

                    Total: |  0:10:29|  3.0%|

   If you add `(require 'planner-timeclock-summary)' to your
`~/.emacs', you can then use it in two ways.

   * Display a temporary buffer

     Call `planner-timeclock-summary-show' and Emacs will ask you which
     day's summary do you want. Choose the date as anywhere else of
     Emacs planner, and a tempory buffer will be displayed with the
     timeclock summary of that day.

     To review tasks over a date range, use
     `planner-timeclock-summary-show-range'. You can use a regexp or a
     function to filter tasks by calling
     `planner-timeclock-summary-show-range-filter'.

   * Rewrite sections of your planner

     Choose this approach if you want timeclock summary to be in their
     own section and you would like them to be readable in your plain
     text files even outside Emacs. Caveat: The timeclock summary
     section should already exist in your template and will be rewritten
     when updated. Tip: Add `planner-timeclock-summary-section'
     (default: `"Timeclock"') to your `planner-day-page-template'.

     To use, call `planner-timeclock-summary-update' in the planner day
     page to update the section. If you want rewriting to be
     automatically performed, call
     `planner-timeclock-summary-insinuate' in your `.emacs' file.

   `planner-timeclock-summary-proj.el' produces task / time breakdowns
on plan pages. Reports are of the form:

     TASK 0 | duration
     TASK 1 | duration
      TOTAL | duration.

   To use, add `(require 'planner-timeclock-summary)' to your
`~/.emacs'. Call `planner-timeclock-summary-proj-current' from a
project page. The report is inserted at the current position in the
buffer. The function `planner-timeclock-summary-proj-section' does the
same but the report is inserted inside a section called `* Report'.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: schedule.el,  Prev: Timeclock,  Up: Scheduling and Time

7.2.4 `schedule.el'
-------------------

`planner-schedule.el' allows you to project task completion time.
Tasks should be of the form:

     #A0 _ 2h Do something
     #B0 _ 1h30m Do something
     #B0 _ 2d Do something
     #B0 _ 2w Do something
     #B0 _ 10s Do something

     s: seconds, m: minutes, h: hours, d: days, w: weeks

   `schedule.el' is included with Planner in the `contrib' directory,
but you can alternatively get it from
`http://www.newartisans.com/johnw/Emacs/schedule.el' if desired.

   `schedule.el' provides a single Lisp function,
`schedule-completion-time'. It takes an Emacs time object and a
quantity of seconds. It returns an Emacs time object that represents
when the given number of seconds will be completed, assuming that work
can only be done during work hours.

   The available work hours are affected by several factors:

  1. If `timeclock.el' is being used, the amount of time left in the
     current work day (`timeclock-workday-remaining') (*note Time
     Intervals: (Emacs)Time Intervals.)

  2. The amount of time in each work day (`schedule-workday')

  3. The definition of a work week (`schedule-week')

  4. Any holidays defined in the Emacs calendar (*note Holidays:
     (Emacs)Holidays.)

  5. Any appointments in the Emacs diary (*note Appointments:
     (Emacs)Appointments.)


   Taking all of the "block out" periods into account,
`schedule-completion-time' will compute when the given number of
seconds will be done, based on your current definitions of time
available.

   As an example, here's a function which, given a list of durations in
seconds, will return a list of completion times starting from the
current moment:


       (defun compute-completion-times (&rest durations)
         ``Compute completion times for a list of DURATIONS (in seconds).''
         (let ((now (current-time)))
           (mapcar
            (function
             (lambda (dura)
               (setq now (schedule-completion-time now dura))))
            durations)))

   To call this function, do:


     (compute-completion-times 3600 7200 3600)

Keys
----

`planner-schedule.el' defines the following keybindings:

   `C-c RET' is bound to `planner-schedule-show-end-project'.  `C-c
C-m' is also bound to `planner-schedule-show-end-project'.

   In XEmacs, `planner-schedule-show-end-project' is bound to `C-c C-T
c-e' and `C-c C-S-t C-e'.

Functions
---------

`planner-schedule.el' defines the following interactive functions:

 -- Function: planner-schedule-show-end-project
     Display the estimated project completion time.

   `schedule.el' does not define any interactive functions, or
keybindings.

7.3 Finances
============

Currently, Planner provides one module dedicated to tracking your
finances. This module works with a program called Ledger.

* Menu:

* Ledger::                      Personal finances: planner-ledger.el


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Ledger,  Prev: Finances,  Up: Finances

7.3.1 Ledger
------------

`planner-ledger.el' provides integration between planner and John
Wiegley's ledger accounting program, which can be found at
`http://newartisans.com/johnw/ledger.tar.gz'.

   To use planner-ledger to insert a ledger balance overview and a list
of pending transactions into planner day pages, make sure that your day
page includes sections that match `planner-ledger-balance-regexp' and
`planner-ledger-pending-regexp'. Example:

     * Tasks

     * Ledger

     ** Pending transactions

     * Notes

   You can manually update ledger sections with the
`planner-ledger-insert-maybe' command.

   You can also automatically update ledger sections with the following
hook:

     (add-hook 'planner-goto-hook 'planner-ledger-insert-maybe)

   You can create ledger entries from specially-formatted tasks using
`planner-ledger-add-entry-from-task'.  Tasks should be of the form
`payment due: payee, amount [comment]'.  Example:

     #A1 _ payment due: foobar, $1000.00 some comment here
     #A2 _ payment due: baz, 1000.00

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-ledger-balance-accounts
     List of accounts to be included or excluded from the balance
     overview.  `+' includes all matching accounts, and `-' excludes
     matching accounts.  See the documentation for `ledger-run-ledger'
     for more details.

 -- User Option: planner-ledger-balance-regexp
     Regular expression matching section for ledger balance.  Do not
     store other data in this section, as it will be overwritten.

 -- User Option: planner-ledger-pending-regexp
     Regular expression matching section for ledger balance.  Do not
     store other data in this section, as it will be overwritten.

 -- User Option: planner-ledger-payment-task-regexp
     Regular expression matching special ledger tasks.

Functions
---------

 -- Function: planner-ledger-insert-maybe
     Update any ledger sections on the current page.

 -- Function: planner-ledger-add-entry-from-task
     Create a ledger entry based on the task at point.  Task should
     match `planner-ledger-payment-task-regexp'.

7.4 Contacts and Conversations
==============================

Planner has two modules available for keeping track of contact and
conversation information. The first uses the Big Brother Database
(BBDB), and the second uses Emacs Relay Chat (ERC). BBDB is a full
contact database. ERC is a client for chatting online on Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) networks. The ERC module for Planner will help you keep
track of online conversations you have if you use ERC for those
conversations, but does not by itself store contact information other
than the time you had the conversation, the network and channel you were
on when you had it, and maybe who you had it with. If you are looking
for a way to manage your full address book, then `planner-bbdb.el' in
combination with BBDB is what you are looking for.

* Menu:

* BBDB::                        Contacts: planner-bbdb.el
* Emacs Relay Chat::            Internet Relay Chat: planner-erc.el


File: planner-el.info,  Node: BBDB,  Next: Emacs Relay Chat,  Prev: Contacts and Conversations,  Up: Contacts and Conversations

7.4.1 BBDB
----------

`planner-bbdb.el' allows you to refer to your contacts easily from
within a planner page. *note the BBDB Manual: (bbdb)Top.

   `[[bbdb://Sacha.*Chua][Sacha]]', for example, will be linked to the
blog, web or net fields of the first matching BBDB record.

   `planner-bbdb.el' does not define any interactive functions, or
keybindings.

7.5 Tracking Research and Resources
===================================

Planner provides three modules for keeping track of information
involving three specific tools: w3m, BibTeX, and `bookmark.el'.

* Menu:

* W3m::                         Web browser: planner-w3m.el
* BibTeX::                      Bibliographies: planner-bibtex.el
* Bookmark::                    Bookmarks: planner-bookmark.el


File: planner-el.info,  Node: W3m,  Next: BibTeX,  Prev: Tracking Research and Resources,  Up: Tracking Research and Resources

7.5.1 W3m
---------

This module allows you to create tasks from a w3m buffer.

   `planner-w3m.el' does not define any interactive functions, or
keybindings.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: BibTeX,  Next: Bookmark,  Prev: W3m,  Up: Tracking Research and Resources

7.5.2 BibTeX
------------

BibTeX URLs are of the form `bibtex:file/name:key'.

   `planner-bibtex.el' does not define any interactive functions.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Bookmark,  Prev: BibTeX,  Up: Tracking Research and Resources

7.5.3 Bookmark
--------------

`planner-bookmark.el' uses the `remember' package to create a note
whenever you create a bookmark (see *note Bookmarks: (Emacs)Bookmarks).
For more information about `remember', please check out

   * `http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode' -
     EmacsWiki.org page

   * `http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/doc/dev/remember/remember.html'
     - Online info documentation

   Configure remember according to the instructions in
`remember-planner.el' so that notes are saved to your planner pages.

 -- User Option: planner-bookmark-take-note-after-set-bookmark-flag
     Non-nil means show a `remember' buffer after setting a new
     bookmark.

   When you create a bookmark, Emacs will open a buffer for your notes.
`C-c C-c' saves the buffer to today's page. If you don't want to save a
note, you can kill the buffer.

   Bookmark URLs are of the form `bookmark://bookmark-name'.

7.6 Tracking Development
========================

Planner has three modules geared toward programmers. Two modules deal
with version control and integrating information from those projects
into the planner page. One module deals with the Gnats bug-tracking
system.

* Menu:

* Log Edit::                    Changelogs: planner-log-edit.el
* PSVN::                        svn changesets: planner-psvn.el

* Gnats::                       Gnats: The GNU bug reporting system


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Log Edit,  Next: PSVN,  Prev: Tracking Development,  Up: Tracking Development

7.6.1 Log Edit
--------------

This module allows you to automatically record CVS (and VC) commits in
today's page.

   You can load the module with `(require 'planner-log-edit)'. When you
load the module, `planner-log-edit-add-note' will be added to
`log-edit-done-hook'.  A note containing the text of the commit and
optionally a list of modified files will be added to today's page if
you use the the Emacs version control interface. (*note Version
Control: (Emacs)Version Control.)

Options
-------

 -- User Option: planner-log-edit-include-files-flag
     Non-nil means include a list of committed files in the note.

 -- User Option: planner-log-edit-notice-commit-function
     Non-nil means include a list of committed files in the note. If you
     want to enable this feature for some projects but not for others,
     set this to a function that returns t only for the commits you
     want to note.

   `planner-log-edit.el' does not define any interactive functions.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: PSVN,  Next: XTLA,  Prev: Log Edit,  Up: Tracking Development

7.6.2 PSVN
----------

This file allows you to refer to your svn changesets easily from within
a Planner page.  You can load the module with `(require 'planner-psvn)'.

   PSVN URLs are of the form
`psvn://http://my.svn-repos.at/svn/project1/trunk@39'

   Additionally there is functionality to generate a note for your
commits via subversion: just set
PLANNER-PSVN-LOG-EDIT-NOTICE-COMMIT-FUNCTION to t.

File: planner-el.info,  Node: XTLA,  Next: Gnats,  Prev: PSVN,  Up: Tracking Development

7.6.3 XTLA
----------

This module allows you to refer to changesets in Tom Lord's Arch (tla)
version control system. You can load the module with `(require
'planner-xtla)'. When you load the module, you can create tasks from
XTLA windows by positioning point on a revision.

   XTLA URLs are of the form
`xtla://miles@gnu.org--gnu-2005/emacs--cvs-trunk--0--patch-19'

   `planner-xtla.el' does not define any interactive functions.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Gnats,  Prev: XTLA,  Up: Tracking Development

7.6.4 Gnats
-----------

`planner-gnats.el' provides support for the GNU problem report
management system Gnats. This module allows you to refer to problem
reports using hyperlinks.

   Configure your Emacs for Gnats access, then add `(require
'planner-gnats)' to your `.emacs'. You can then create tasks from Gnats
edit or view buffers.

   To add keybindings to Gnats, use `(planner-gnats-insinuate)'.

   Gnats URLs are of the form `gnats:pr-number'.

File: planner-el.info,  Node: Customizing Your Day Pages,  Next: Variables to Customize,  Prev: Advanced Configuration,  Up: Advanced Configuration

8.1 Customizing Your Day Pages
==============================

With the variable `planner-day-page-template', you can define how you
want any newly created day planner pages to look.

   You might want to include a section for your diary entries. For how
to do this, see *Note Diary::.

   You can add interactive Lisp buttons with the `planner-lisp.el'
module. (*note Interactive Lisp::)

   Your `planner-day-page-template' can also include `|<lisp>|' tags.

   For more complex day pages, you can set `planner-day-page-template'
to a function that will be called from an empty day page buffer. The
function should initialize the contents of the day page.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Variables to Customize,  Next: Ideas for Other Keybindings,  Prev: Customizing Your Day Pages,  Up: Advanced Configuration

8.2 Variables to Customize
==========================

If you want to change `planner-directory' and some other variables,
either use Customize (`M-x customize-group RET planner RET') or use
`setq'.  An example of the latter follows.

     (setq planner-directory "~/Plans")

   Other user options are:

 -- User Option: planner-use-day-pages
     If you really don't like day pages, you can set this variable to
     nil and you won't be prompted for dates for tasks (and notes, if
     using `remember-planner').

 -- User Option: planner-use-plan-pages
     If you really don't like plan pages, you can set this variable to
     nil and you won't be prompted for plan pages for tasks (and notes,
     if using `remember-planner').

 -- User Option: planner-mode-hook
     List of functions to run after `planner-mode' is initialized.

 -- User Option: planner-tasks-file-behavior
     This variable controls what happens to files Planner opens by
     itself.  If your tasks are associated with plan pages, the plan
     pages are updated whenever a task is rescheduled.  This could lead
     to a lot of open buffers as Planner applies updates to all linked
     files.  By default, Planner is configured to do nothing.  A value
     of `save' means save but do not close buffers, and a value of
     `nil' means do not save any of the buffers.

 -- User Option: planner-add-task-at-end-flag
     This variable controls where new tasks are created.  Non-nil means
     create tasks at the bottom of the first task block.  If you set
     this to non-nil, new tasks will be listed in order of creation
     (oldest).  Tasks carried over from previous days will appear at
     the bottom of the list.

     Nil means create tasks at the top of the first task block.
     Carried-over tasks and newly created tasks are prominently placed
     on top of the list of tasks for the day.

 -- User Option: planner-default-page
     Default page for created tasks.  This is used as the initial value
     for tasks.  After you create a task, it will be set to the
     previous page used.

 -- User Option: planner-hide-task-status-when-highlighting
     Font-locking for tasks may be enough for you to determine status
     and priority.  Set this to non-nil if you want to hide the status
     marker and rely on font-locking instead.

 -- User Option: planner-create-task-hook
     Functions run after creating a task. `planner-id' hooks into this.

 -- User Option: planner-expand-name-favor-future-p
     If non-nil, partial dates (ex: `2' or `5.2') are completed to
     dates in the future instead of using the current year and month.

 -- User Option: planner-task-dates-favor-future-p
     Like `planner-expand-name-favor-future-p', but only for tasks.

 -- User Option: planner-publish-dates-first-p
     Non-nil means list day pages first in the planner index.

8.3 Ideas for Other Keybindings
===============================

By default and for backward compatibility, the following operations do
not have keybindings, and are only accessible from the Planner menu:

   * `planner-copy-or-move-region'

   * `planner-delete-task'

   * `planner-task-delegated'

   * `planner-task-pending'

   * `planner-task-open'

   * `planner-renumber-tasks'


   You may find it easier to install keybindings for those operations by
inserting the following in your `.emacs' (or `_emacs').  Note: This
changes some of the default keybindings for Planner.

     (planner-install-extra-task-keybindings)

   If you install the extra task keybindings, your keybindings will
include:

   * `C-c C-t' will be unbound from the default and will serve as the
     prefix for the other task keybindings.

   * `C-c C-t C-t': `planner-create-task-from-buffer'.

   * `C-c C-t C-k': `planner-delete-task'.

   * `C-c C-t C-u': `planner-update-task'.

   * `C-c C-t C-c': `planner-copy-or-move-task'.

   * `C-c C-t C-S-c': `planner-copy-or-move-region'.

   * `C-c C-t C-x': `planner-task-done'.

   * `C-c C-t C-S-x': `planner-task-cancelled'.

   * `C-c C-t C-d': `planner-task-delegated'.

   * `C-c C-t C-p': `planner-task-pending'.

   * `C-c C-t C-o': `planner-task-in-progress'.

   * `C-c C-t C-r': `planner-raise-task'.

   * `C-c C-t C-l': `planner-lower-task'.

   * `C-c C-t C-n': `planner-renumber-tasks'.


   Other keybindings can be configured by adding this to your `.emacs'
(or `_emacs'):

     (planner-install-extra-context-keybindings)

   This will set up the following keybindings:

   * `shift up' `planner-move-up'

   * `shift down' `planner-move-down'

   * `shift right' `planner-jump-to-link'

9.1 Keeping Track of Time
=========================

One of the coolest things you can do with Planner is keep track of how
much time you spend not only on projects but even on particular tasks.
`planner-timeclock.el' makes it as easy and natural as marking a task
as in progress, postponed, or done. This can help you determine just
how much time you spend working each day. If you add estimates to your
task descriptions, you'll also be able to use this information to
improve your time estimation skills.

   Here's how you can keep track of the time you

   Then the fun began. I wanted to see if I could match my estimates.
Before I started working on a task, I used `C-c TAB' to mark it `in
progress' and start the clock. If I decided to work on something else,
I used `C-c TAB' to clock out of the previous task and clock into the
new one.

   When I finished it, I used `C-c C-x' (`planner-task-done') to mark
it completed and automatically clock out. This is not yet done for
cancelled tasks, so I clocked out of those manually with `C-c C-o'
(`timeclock-out'). I also clocked out whenever I caught myself being
distracted so that the totals wouldn't include the time I spent
chatting on #emacs or checking out del.icio.us links. =) At the end of
the day, I used `planner-timeclock-summary-show-range-filter' to show
me the time elapsed for all of the tasks I'd worked on over the past
two days.  Here's the report for that project, edited to reflect how it
looks on my screen and annotated with comments:

     Time elapsed: 31:47:48, Time clocked: 10:41:41
     Time clocked ratio: 33.6%

   The time record isn't perfect. I cancelled some tasks after thinking
about them a little and did some tasks simultaneously. Sometimes I
didn't notice that I was getting distracted, too. Still, having all of
that time information neatly summarized made me realize a number of
things.

   First, I goof off much less when I have a nice, broken-down task list
in front of me. There's just something about knowing there's a five- or
ten-minute hack you can get out of the way. I found myself looking
forward to getting to the next task just to see if I could make my
estimate. That said, seeing a five-minute task stretch and stretch due
to unforeseen problems did make me a little nervous. I should probably
just make generous estimates so that I don't end up with bugs because
of haste.

   Second, I don't goof off as much as I thought I did, although there's
still room for improvement. Yesterday's workday was 9:00 - 12:00, 1:00
- 5:30-7.5 hours. Today was the last day of work, so cleaning and
celebration interrupted my hacking at around 3:00-5 hours of work.
According to my task list, 10:41/12:30 was productive work. Hmm. 1:49
hours unclocked time when I was thinking or goofing off.
planner-timeclock-summary-show for today reveals that I actually
clocked 5:30 today, which means the goofing off happened yesterday.
That makes sense; I remember a pretty long unclocked segment
recuperating from Japanese overload. (This was before we came up with
the task list.)

   Third, keeping track of time is way, way cool even if you don't bill
anyone for your time.

   Like the idea? It's easy to try out. Just add

     (require 'planner-timeclock)
     (require 'planner-timeclock-summary)

   to your ~/.emacs. If you want to try it out now, eval those
statements in your Emacs session. After that, simply use `C-c TAB' to
"clock in" a task before you start working on it and `C-c C-x'
(`planner-task-done') to mark it completed. `M-x planner-task-pending'
also clocks out the current task if it was clocked in. To see a summary
of how you spent your day, check out the different functions in
`planner-timeclock-summary'.

   See *Note Timeclock:: for more details.

   Happy hacking!

9.2 Other Interactive Functions
===============================

With `planner.el' loaded, you can use any of the functions in this
section by typing `M-x' followed by the name of the function. Many of
these functions are also bound to keys.

   For a list of Planner keybindings, see *Note Planner Keybindings::.

   They are listed in no particular order.

   `planner.el' defines the following interactive functions:

 -- Function: planner-create-high-priority-task-from-buffer
     Create a high priority task based on this buffer.  Do not use this
     in LISP programs. Instead, set the value of
     PLANNER-DEFAULT-TASK-PRIORITY and call `planner-create-task' or
     `planner-create-task-from-buffer'.

 -- Function: defun planner-create-medium-priority-task-from-buffer
     Create a medium-priority task based on this buffer.  Do not use
     this in LISP programs. Instead, set the value of
     PLANNER-DEFAULT-TASK-PRIORITY and call `planner-create-task' or
     `planner-create-task-from-buffer'.

 -- Function: planner-create-low-priority-task-from-buffer
     Create a high-priority task based on this buffer.  Do not use this
     in LISP programs. Instead, set the value of
     PLANNER-DEFAULT-TASK-PRIORITY and call `planner-create-task' or
     `planner-create-task-from-buffer'.

 -- Function: planner-install-extra-context-keybindings
     Install extra context-sensitive keybindings. These keybindings
     conflict with `windmove.el', but might be useful.

 -- Function: planner-narrow-to-section section &optional create
     Widen to the whole page and narrow to the section labelled
     SECTION.  If CREATE is non-nil and the section is not found, the
     section is created.  Return non-nil if SECTION was found or
     created.

 -- Function: planner-save-buffers
     Save all planner-mode buffers.

 -- Function: planner-seek-to-first section
     Positions the point at the specified SECTION, or `Tasks' if not
     specified.

 -- Function: planner-save-buffers
     Save all planner buffers.

 -- Function: planner-calendar-insinuate
     This hooks Planner into  Emacs Calendar (*note Calendar/Diary:
     (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.).

     It adds special planner key bindings to `calendar-mode-map'.
     After this function is evaluated, you can use the following
     planner-related keybindings in `calendar-mode-map':

    `n'
          Jump to the planner page for the current day.

    `N'
          Display the planner page for the current day.


 -- Function: planner-kill-calendar-files
     Remove planner files shown from Calendar (*note Calendar/Diary:
     (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.).


 -- Function: planner-calendar-goto
     Goto the plan page corresponding to the calendar date (*note
     Calendar/Diary: (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.).

 -- Function: planner-calendar-show
     Show the plan page for the calendar date under point in another
     window (*note Calendar/Diary: (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.).

 -- Function: planner-calendar-select
     Return to `planner-read-date' with the date currently selected
     (*note Calendar/Diary: (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.).

 -- Function: planner-jump-to-link
     Jump to the item linked to by the current item.

 -- Function: planner-move-up
     Move a task up. You can use this to indicate that you will do a
     task before another one. On a note, go to the previous note. On a
     headline, go to the previous headline of the same depth.

 -- Function: planner-move-down
     Move down. You can use this to indicate that you will do a task
     after another one. On a note, go to the next note. On a headline,
     go to the next headline of the same depth.

9.3 Planner Keybindings
=======================

In order to refresh and renumber all of your tasks according to their
actual order in the buffer, simply save the file or call `M-x
planner-renumber-tasks'.

   Here is a summary of the keystrokes available:

`M-x plan'
     Begin your planning session.  This goes to the last day for which
     there is any planning info (or today if none), allowing you to
     review, and create/move tasks from that day.

`C-c C-u'
     Move a task up.

`C-c C-d'
     Move a task down.

`C-c C-s'
     Mark the task as in progress or delegated.

`C-c C-x'
     Mark the task as finished.

`C-c C-t'
     Create a task associated with the current Wiki page. If you are on
     the opening line of a Note entry, it is assumed that the note
     itself is the origin of the task.

`C-c C-c'
     Move or copy the current task to another date. If the current task
     is an original (meaning you are in the buffer where's defined,
     hopefully a planning page) then it will be copied, and the
     original task will also now point to the copy.  If the current
     task is a copy, it will just be moved to the new day, and the
     original task's link will be updated.

`C-c C-n'
     Jump to today's task page.  If you call
     `(planner-calendar-insinuate)', typing `n' in the Emacs calendar
     (*note Calendar/Diary: (Emacs)Calendar/Diary.) will jump to
     today's task page.

`C-c C-x'
     `planner-task-done'

`C-c C-z'
     `planner-task-in-progress'

`C-c C-d'
     `planner-lower-task'

9.4 Sample Configuration Files
==============================

This section includes some sample configuration files. This way, once
you've got the hang of the basics, you can see some different, more
advanced, setups.

   There is no One True Way to plan. Every person is different. We hope
you'll find a good starting point among the example configurations
below. If what you want to do does not perfectly fit under one of these
examples, please post a description of the way you plan to our mailing
list (*note Getting Help::).  We look forward to helping you customizing
planner to fit your needs.

File: planner-el.info,  Node: File Organization,  Next: Bare-Bones Planning,  Prev: Sample Configuration Files,  Up: Sample Configuration Files

9.4.1 File Organization
-----------------------

   * *Tasks, schedule and notes on day pages.*

     By default, tasks, schedule entries and notes are filed on day
     pages.  This makes it easy for you to see all the entries relevant
     to a single day without becoming overwhelmed with information.
     Unfinished tasks are carried over to the next day when you use
     `M-x plan', so it's always kept up to date. Completed tasks are
     left on the day page you finished them on, which helps when
     reviewing one's progress and writing accomplishment reports.

   * *Cross-referenced with plan pages.*

     You can associate your tasks with projects either when you create
     the task or later, with `M-x planner-replan-task'. This makes it
     easy for you to see all the information associated with a
     particular project. If you use RememberMode to create notes, you
     will also be able to associate notes with a plan page.

   * *Just plan pages.*

     If your tasks don't usually have dates, you can turn day pages off
     by customizing `planner-use-day-pages'. If so, then all of your
     tasks and notes will be stored on the WelcomePage and/or a plan
     page.



File: planner-el.info,  Node: Bare-Bones Planning,  Next: Bare-Bones Planning with Plan Pages,  Prev: File Organization,  Up: Sample Configuration Files

9.4.2 Bare-Bones Planning
-------------------------

You can keep all of your tasks, notes and schedules in a single file:
WelcomePage.  This is good for people who are used to storing all of
their information in a flat text file.  By storing your information in
planner, you'll be able to take advantage of automatic hyperlinking to
files and other resources.  You can also sort your tasks by priority
and status.

   To set your system up for bare-bones planning, set the
`planner-use-day-pages' variable to nil before loading planner.  For
example, you can put this in your `~/.emacs' (or `_emacs'):

     (setq planner-use-day-pages nil)
     (setq planner-default-page nil)
     (require 'planner)

   When you create a task or note, planner will not prompt you for a
date.  If you press <RET> when prompted for a plan page, it will accept
the default of nil, so no other plan pages will be used.  All of your
data will be kept in one file, which can then be easily backed up.

   You can use commands like `planner-create-task-from-buffer' to
create tasks, or you can type tasks in manually.  You can edit or
delete anything in the page without having to update other files.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Bare-Bones Planning with Plan Pages,  Next: Tasks on Plan Pages with Some Day Pages,  Prev: Bare-Bones Planning,  Up: Sample Configuration Files

9.4.3 Bare-Bones Planning with Plan Pages
-----------------------------------------

When you create a task or note, Planner.el can copy this to a plan
page. Plan pages allow you to see an overview of all the data for a
project.

   For convenience, the `planner-create-task-from-buffer' command
prompts you for a plan page when you create a task.


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Tasks on Plan Pages with Some Day Pages,  Next: Hierarchical Tasks,  Prev: Bare-Bones Planning with Plan Pages,  Up: Sample Configuration Files

9.4.4 Tasks on Plan Pages with Some Day Pages
---------------------------------------------

If most of your tasks are associated with plan pages but you want to
schedule some tasks on day pages, you can leave day pages on (default)
and then write a function that turns off day pages. For example, the
following code snippet turns off day pages for task creation from
buffers.

     (require 'planner)

     (defun my-planner-create-task-from-buffer ()
       "Call `planner-create-task-from-buffer', but without dates."
       (interactive)
       (let ((planner-use-day-pages nil))
         (call-interactively 'planner-create-task-from-buffer)))


File: planner-el.info,  Node: Hierarchical Tasks,  Prev: Tasks on Plan Pages with Some Day Pages,  Up: Sample Configuration Files

9.4.5 Hierarchical Tasks
------------------------

You can use `allout.el' or other modes for outlining to support
hierarchical tasks in plan pages. No special support is needed.

   Tasks created by `planner-create-task-from-buffer' and
`planner-create-task' are created in the `* Tasks' section.  If
`planner-add-task-at-end-flag' is non-nil, tasks are added to the end
of the first task block, else they are added to the beginning.  You can
then copy and paste tasks into your preferred hierarchy.  Blank lines
delimit blocks of tasks upon which automatic sorting is performed.

   You can also type in tasks manually. You may find this approach
faster when you are comfortable with planner.

   For example, a `LearnPlanner' plan page might contain the following
lines:

     * Learn how to use planner.el

     ** Installation

     #C0 _ Decide where to put Planner
     #C0 _ Download the archives

     ** Configuration

     *** Load path

     #C0 _ Figure out how to add things to my load path
     #C0 _ Actually add it to my load path

     ...

   If you create tasks for the finest level of detail available at the
moment, you can schedule them onto day pages with `C-c C-c'
(`planner-copy-or-move-task'). Then you can use `planner-jump-to-link'
to switch between the day page and the plan page link.

Appendix A GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*************************************

                         Version 2, June 1991
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

A.1 Preamble
============

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
A.2 Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
===========================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
