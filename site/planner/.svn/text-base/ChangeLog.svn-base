2006-08-01  Adrian Aichner  <adrian@xemacs.org>

	* timeclock.el: Keep timeclock-file buffer around, so that an
	encrypted timeclock-file does not have to be opened on each
	clocking operation (requiring entry of encryption key).

	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log): Don't kill timeclock-file buffer.
	* timeclock.el (timeclock-log-data): Use
	`timeclock-get-timeclock-file-buffer', which avoids reading
	timeclock-file, if it's already in a live buffer.

	* timeclock.el (timeclock-visit-timelog): Ditto.

See ChangeLog.3 for earlier changes.
