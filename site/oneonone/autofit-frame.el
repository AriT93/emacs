;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    Automatically resize one-window frames to fit.
;;
;;  Functions are provided here to automatically resize each frame to
;;  fit its selected window, when there is no other window in the
;;  frame.  Standard Emacs primitive functions are redefined to do
;;  this: `display-buffer' and `switch-to-buffer'.
;;
;;  Automatic frame resizing is also provided here implicitly for
;;  functions `pop-to-buffer', `switch-to-buffer-other-window', and
;;  `switch-to-buffer-other-frame', since they ultimately use
;;  `display-buffer'. (Command `switch-to-buffer' does not use
;;  `display-buffer', so it is redefined separately here.)
;;
;;  Put the following in your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs'),
;;  in order to provide for automatic frame resizing:
;;
;;    (require 'autofit-frame)
;;    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)
;;
;;  The second line here causes newly created frames to be fitted to
;;  their buffer (window).  Even if you load `auto-fit-frames.el', you
;;  will still need to do this, because `display-buffer' and
;;  `switch-to-buffer' are not called when a new frame is created.
;;
;;  To automatically fit frames that show a temporary buffer in their
;;  sole window, add this to your initialization file also:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-show-hook
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;  User option (variable) `autofit-frames-flag' turns on and off the
;;  automatic resizing defined here.  Setting it to nil turns it off:
;;  (setq autofit-frames-flag nil).  You can also bind it to nil to
;;  temporarily inhibit frame resizing in Lisp code:
;;
;;         (let ((autofit-frames-flag nil))...)
;;
;;
;;  New user option (variable) defined here: `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;  New function defined here (useful as a `temp-buffer-show-hook'):
;;
;;    `fit-frame-if-one-window'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following EMACS PRIMITIVES are REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `display-buffer' -
;;     1) Uses `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) Resizes frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;     ***************************************************************
;;     NOTE: It would be better to rewrite the C code of
;;           `display-buffer' so that the frame is _not_ resized if an
;;           existing frame is simply raised.  This is because the
;;           user may have manually resized the frame, and we don't
;;           want to override this.  The code here unfortunately does
;;           _not_ respect the user in this regard.
;;     ***************************************************************
;;
;;  `switch-to-buffer' -
;;     1) Uses `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) If current window is dedicated, then use another window.
;;     3) Resizes frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (unless BUFFER is already the `current-buffer').
;;
;;
;;  This file loads file `fit-frame.el', which provides the main
;;  functionality behind the automatic frame resizing.  See it for
;;  user options to do such things as customize default frame sizes:
;;
;;  `create-empty-frame-height', `create-empty-frame-width',
;;  `create-empty-special-display-frame-height',
;;  `create-empty-special-display-frame-width',
;;  `create-frame-max-height', `create-frame-max-height-percent',
;;  `create-frame-max-width', `create-frame-max-width-percent',
;;  `create-frame-min-height', `create-frame-min-width', and
;;  `inhibit-fit-frame-flag'.
;;
;;  The reason for separating the code here from that in
;;  `fit-frame.el' is to let you load that code but not load the code
;;  here, if you do not want to redefine Emacs primitives.
;;
;;  This file was formerly called `shrink-fit-all.el', then
;;  `auto-resize-frames.el'.
;;
;;
;;  See also these files for other frame commands:
;;
;;     `doremi-frm.el'    - Incrementally adjust frame properties
;;                          using arrow keys and/or mouse wheel.
;;
;;     `frame-cmds.el'    - Miscellaneous frame and window commands.
;;
;;     `thumb-frm.el'     - Shrink frames to a thumbnail size and
;;                          restore them again.
;;
;;     `zoom-frm.el'      - Zoom a frame, so that its font becomes
;;                          larger or smaller.

;;      switch-to-buffer: Don't require existing buffer.
;; 2005/05/28 dadams
;;      autofit-frames-flag: defvar -> defcustom.  Added defgroup fit-frame.
;;      switch-to-buffer: Use explicit default in read-buffer.

;;      Renamed resize-* to fit-*, per RMS.
;;      Renamed automatically-resize-frames-p to autofit-frames-flag.
;; 2004/09/21 dadams
;;      Commented-out redefinition of pop-to-buffer.  Removed it from intro.
;; 2004/06/01 dadams
;;      1. Replaced fit-frame-when-display-p, fit-frame-when-pop-to-p,
;;         and fit-frame-when-switch-to-p by
;;         automatically-resize-frames-p.
;;      2. Removed pop-to-buffer and
;;         resize-frame-if-one-window-and-cond.
;;      3. Renamed fit-frame-* to resize-frame-*.  Renamed file.
;;      4. switch-to-buffer: Don't resize if buffer is already current.
;; 2004/05/07 dadams
;;      Updated to work with Emacs 21:
;;        pop-to-buffer has additional arg and doc-string changes
;;        display-buffer has doc-string changes

  "Make BUFFER appear in some window but don't select it.
BUFFER can be a buffer or a buffer name.

The variables `special-display-buffer-names', `special-display-regexps',

buffer names are handled.

If optional argument FRAME is `visible', search all visible frames.
