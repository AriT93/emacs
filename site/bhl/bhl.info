This is the manual of bhl version 1.9.

   bhl is an Emacs mode that enables you to convert a plain text file
into an HTML, SGML, LaTeX, Texinfo, Wiki and TXT file. Since you can
run bhl _offline_, it's also a standalone format: writing a bhl file
makes it ready for generic conversions.

   "bhl" is an acronym for: Brute (i.e. "plain") to Html and LaTeX.

   I have been asked if there was an easy way to pronounce "bhl". Yes,
there is. `Bhl-' is the indo-european root for "blow" (and derivative
but less poetic verbs like "blather"). So, just say "blow".

1 Overview
**********

1.1 What is BHL?
================

bhl is a text formatting and publishing tool. It is an Emacs mode that
provides two kinds of tools: tools for editing a plain text file as an
implicitly structured document, and tools for converting this document
into other formats: HTML, SGML, LaTeX, Texinfo and TXT.

   In order to be readable by bhl, a plain text file must fit some
syntactic conventions. This conventions are neither completely
universal nor specially odd. They are chosen among the most useful and
the most convenient text formatting conventions. The purpose of this
mode is to use the most _invisible_ and _convenient_ syntax.
"Invisible syntax" means that the source file must be as readable as
possible - like any plain text file must be. "Convenient syntax" means
that it must fit the users' habits.

   For example, `*word*' appears in bold; `_word_' appears in emphasis;
lists and URLs follow `StructuredText' or `Wiki' conventions; the
numbering of sections respects logic and intuition.  (*Note The
syntax::.)

   In short: there is nothing you have to learn to write your documents
with the bhl mode (just try, it's true).

   bhl is not `WYSIWYG' since you are only editing text.  bhl is not
`WYSIWYM' (like `LyX'), since what you mean is editing text. So, what
is bhl? It is `WYSIWYS(IWYS)': What You See Is What You See (Is What
You See).  Editing text is editing text.

1.2 Why should I use BHL?
=========================

_Happy sectioning_
     You can easily update the numbering of sections and
     (sub)subsections.  You can easily choose/convert the style of
     sectioning. You can insert the table of content where you want.
     *Note Sections::.

_Happy links_
     bhl likes links: you can quickly jump to the next link, follow it
     (either an URL or a WikiName), browse through the complete list of
     your document's links and insert this list into your document.
     *Note The list of links::.

_Happy specifications_
     You can specify some conversion properties inside a document, so
     that bhl converts this document properly.  *Note Specifications::.

_Happy footnotes_
     Footnotes won't stay aside. You can convert each of them, even if
     you are not using the classical numeric style.

2 Installing BHL
****************

You have just downloaded `bhl.tar.gz' on `http://www.nongnu.org/bhl'.
Untar the archive like this:

     ~$ tar zxvf `bhl.tar.gz'

   Go to the bhl-*/ directory and set up the `Makefile'.  Once this is
done, just compile and install like this:

     ~$ make
     ~$ make install

   If you want to install bhl in your `/usr/local/' or `/usr/share/'
paths, you need to have `superuser' (i.e. `root') permissions.  But
don't worry: at the end of the install procedure, a message tells you
if something has gone wrong.

   If you want to generate and install the `bhl.info' file:

     ~$ make info
     ~$ make install-info

   If you want the printed manual (`PDF'):

     ~$ make pdf

   If you want the HTML manual:

     ~$ make html

   If you want to clean up the directory:

     ~$ make clean

   You can add these lines to your `~/.emacs.el':

     (autoload 'bhl-mode "bhl" "BHL Mode" t)
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.bhl$" . bhl-mode))

   The last line enables you to associate a new extension (i.e. `.bhl')
with the bhl editing mode, so that bhl will automatically be loaded
when you open a `.bhl' ending file.

3 The syntax
************

Ordinarily, a plain text file has no visible or invisible syntax.  To
be bhl-readable, a file has to respect some conventions.

* Menu:

* Title and paragraphs::        Things you cannot avoid
* Sections::                    Sectioning styles
* Fonts and environments::      Beautifiers and Cie
* Escaping characters::         To escape or not to escape
* Handling links::              How BHL handles links
* Handling lists::              How BHL handles lists
* Handling tables::             How BHL handles tables
* Handling images::             How BHL handles images


File: bhl.info,  Node: Title and paragraphs,  Next: Sections,  Prev: The syntax,  Up: The syntax

3.1 Title and paragraphs
========================

The title is mandatory.  bhl tries to read it in the very first lines
of the buffer.  The title is on a line that does not include any
newline or tab character.

   The subtitle is not mandatory.  It is currently included in the HTML,
TXT and Texinfo output.  You can include it as a specification, like
this:

     #!subtitle!My subtile subtitle

   For details on how to format and insert specifications, *Note
Specifications::.

   The paragraphs always begin at the beginning of the line.  Don't
indent paragraphs: restrict indentation to lists.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Sections,  Next: Fonts and environments,  Prev: Title and paragraphs,  Up: The syntax

3.2 Sections
============

bhl handles three levels of section: sections, subsections and
subsubsections.

   bhl handles five different sectioning styles: `num', `alpha',
`aster', `equal-sign' and `user-defined'.  The default style is set to
numerical.

   Here is a table with examples of each sectioning style:

`num'
     1.<SPC>A section
     1.1.<SPC>A subsection
     1.1.1.<SPC>A subsubsection
`alpha'
     A.<SPC>A section
     A.A.<SPC>A subsection
     A.A.A.<SPC>A subsubsection
`aster'
     *<SPC>A section
     **<SPC>A subsection
     ***<SPC>A subsubsection
`equal-sign'
     =<SPC>A section
     ==<SPC>A subsection
     ===<SPC>A subsubsection

   You can choose the default style of sectioning by modifying
BHL-SECTIONING-DEFAULT-STYLE.  This is the default sectioning style for
any newly created bhl file.

   When you find an already existant bhl file, bhl tries to guess its
sectioning style, if you've set BHL-AUTOGUESS-STYLE-FLAG to `t' - which
is its default value.  At any time, you can ask bhl to guess the style
with `bhl-guess-style', which is bound to <C-c M-s> (and also available
from the menu, as usual).

   For example, suppose you are using the alphabetical style in
`foo.bhl' and your BHL-SECTIONING-DEFAULT-STYLE is set to `num', then
bhl will automatically turn the current style to `alpha'.  If bhl is
not able to recognize any style, it sets the sectioning style to the
value of BHL-SECTIONING-DEFAULT-STYLE.

   Don't mix sectioning styles!  If bhl finds a numerical section, it
will consider that all the (sub)sections are numerical, which is
actually rather stupid, but I've no time for this at the moment.

   You can switch from one style to another style from the menu or with
`bhl-sectioning-switch-style'.  This command reads a style from the
minibuffer and converts the (sub)sections' prefix into the chosen style.

   If you choose to use your own style, you have to manually customize
BHL-MY-SECTIONING-REGEXP-LIST. *Note Global options::.  This variable
includes a list of the three regular expressions that match
respectively the sections, subsections and subsubsections.  Please note
that `bhl-udpate-toc' won't work anymore if you set
BHL-SECTIONING-DEFAULT-STYLE to `my'.

   You can update the sections' prefix (numbers or letters) with <C-c
M-t>, which is the default key binding for `bhl-update-toc'.

3.3 Fonts and environments
==========================

This section describes the use of font beautifiers, environments and
horizontal rules.

* Menu:

* Font beautifiers::            Bold, emphasis, underline, truetype
* Comments::                    Inserting comments
* Environments::                Verbatim and minipage
* Horizontal rules::            and their alignment


File: bhl.info,  Node: Font beautifiers,  Next: Comments,  Prev: Fonts and environments,  Up: Fonts and environments

3.3.1 Font beautifiers
----------------------

Font beautifiers allow you to emphasize, underline, boldify and
truetypify some words.

   In the SGML and Texinfo outputs, _underline_ means put in italic,
just like _emphasis_.  In the HTML and LaTeX output, _underline_ means
underline truly.

   If you want to put your text in bold-italic, use `_*this order*_'
rather than `*_this order_*'.  Note that bold-italic is not available
in the Texinfo output.

   If you want to insert an underscore or an asterisk that has no
syntactic meaning, put an escape character before: `\*' and `\_'.  The
same is possible with the comment character `#'. *Note Comments::.

   You can choose a font beautifier for a specific region with the
`bhl-change-font-' commands. *Note Changing font::.


   Here are the tags to be used in your bhl file if you want to change
the fonts:

`*a word*'
     put `a word' in bold font.

`_a word_'
     put `a word' in emphasis font.

`_*a word*_'
     put `a word' in bold and italic font.

`__a word__'
     underline `a word'.

`==a word=='
     put  `a word' in truetype font.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Comments,  Next: Environments,  Prev: Font beautifiers,  Up: Fonts and environments

3.3.2 Comments
--------------

The character for introducing new comments is `#'.

   You can insert comments wherever you want, but comments always end
at the end of the current line. There is no "ending-comment" character.

   If you want to insert a `#' which should not introduce a new
comment, use the escape sequence `\#'.

   You can comment the current region with `bhl-comment-region' <C-c ;>
and uncommment it by adding a symbolic prefix to `bhl-comment-region'
<C-u C-c ;>.

   You can make comments invisible with `bhl-hide-comment' and make
them visible again with `C-u bhl-hide-comment'.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Environments,  Next: Horizontal rules,  Prev: Comments,  Up: Fonts and environments

3.3.3 Environments
------------------

bhl handles three environments: `quote', `verbatim' and `minipage'.
The first one quotes some part of text. The second one may be useful
for inserting code into a documentation.  The third one creates a
minipage inside the main page, with or without borders.

3.3.3.1 Quote environment
.........................

To quote some part, just add one single tab in the beginning of each
line. Here is an example:

             Put some words here.
             Put some words here.
             Put some words here.
             Put some words here.

3.3.3.2 Verbatim environment
............................

Here is the syntax of the `verbatim' environment:

     --
     Put some words here.
     --

   Attention: two dashes are the default delimiters for the `verbatim'
environment, while four dashes are markers for horizontal rules.

   Remember that the highlighting of dashes indicates the syntaxic role
they play when BHL-SPECIAL-FACE differs from BHL-HR-FACE (which is the
default case). *Note Horizontal rules::.

   The BHL-VERBATIM-IGNORE variable contains a list of syntactic
elements that have no meaning inside a verbatim environment.  This
means that those syntactic elements won't be converted, even if they
are fontified. *Note Global options::.

3.3.3.3 Minipage environment
............................

Here an example of how to insert a `minipage':

     %%%[12cm]
     This minipage (12cm) will be centered without border.
     %%%

     <%%[10cm]
     This minipage (10cm) will be put on the left without border.
     %%%

     >-%
     This minipage will be put on the right with borders.
     %%%

   The basic indicator for the beginning and the end of a minipage
environment is `%%%' at the beginning of a line.  This indicates a
centered minipage, without border and of the same width as the main
page.

   By replacing the first `%' with a `<' or a `>', you put the minipage
respectively on the left or on the right.  For example, `<%%%%'
indicates a left aligned minipage which has the same width as the main
page.

   By replacing the second `%' with a dash (`-'), you put solid borders
on the minipage.  For example, `<-%%%%%' indicates the beginning of a
minipage that has the same width as the main page, put on the left with
solid borders.

   The length can be put into square brackets like this: `%%%[8cm]'.
It is optional.  Avoid using relative lengths such as "40%": the `%'
character is syntax-sensible in the LaTeX environment.  Use only
absolute lengths and common units.

   Minipages are properly converted only for the HTML, LaTeX and Texinfo
outputs.  For the Texinfo output, you can choose what a centered
minipage looks like with BHL-TEXI-CENTERED-MINIPAGE-TAG.  For the SGML
output, you can choose what a minipage looks like with
BHL-SGML-MINIPAGE-TAG.  `bhl2txt' does not convert minipages, it simply
strips the `%%%' at the beginning of the line.

   You can insert a minipage with `bhl-insert-minipage'. *Note
Inserting::.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Horizontal rules,  Prev: Environments,  Up: Fonts and environments

3.3.4 Horizontal rules
----------------------

A horizontal rule is represented by at less four dashes (`----' -
Small), equal signs (`====' - Large) or slashes (`////' - X-Large) at
the beginning of a line.

   The first character can be replaced by an indicator of alignment.

   Attention: horizontal rules are not converted in the SGML and Texinfo
formats.

     ----[12cm]
     <---[12cm]
     >---[12cm]

   The first line will be centered.  The second line will be put on the
left.  The third line will be put on the right.  The width of these
lines is 12cm.  The length is optional: you can simply insert `----',
`====' or `////'.

   You can insert a horizontal rule with `bhl-insert-hr'. *Note
Inserting::.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Escaping characters,  Next: Handling links,  Prev: Fonts and environments,  Up: The syntax

3.4 Escaping characters
=======================

You can escape four characters: asterisk (`*'), underscore (`_'), sharp
`#' and backslash `\'.  When escaped, these characters have no
syntactic effect anymore.  Escaping backslashes only makes sense for
the `bhl2latex' conversion.

   When converting into LaTeX, bhl escapes some characters by itself.
These characters are: `$ & % { }'.  Attention: the `bhl2latex'
conversion does NOT _automatically_ convert backslashes.  You've to
insert something like `$\backslash$' by yourself or escape them like
`\\'.  When converting into Texinfo, bhl escapes `@ { }'.

   If you don't want that bhl escapes those characters, just escape
them by yourself in the bhl file.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Handling links,  Next: Handling lists,  Prev: Escaping characters,  Up: The syntax

3.5 Handling links
==================

3.5.1 What is a link?
---------------------

There are two kinds of links: URLs and WikiNames.  An URL is... you
know what it is.  A WikiName is a mixed-case word like "MyWikiName".
When the cursor is on a link, you can hit <RET> or <mouse-2> to follow
it.  Following an URL calls `bhl-browse-url-function'.  Following a
WikiName finds a new file whose name is the concatenation of the
WikiName and the `.bhl' extension.

   You can downcase this resulting name by setting
BHL-DOWNCASE-WIKIFILES-NAMES-FLAG to non-`nil'.  You can also change
the default extension of WikiFiles names by setting
BHL-DEFAULT-WIKIFILES-EXTENSION.  The list of mixed-case strings that
shouldn't be considered as WikiNames is stored in
BHL-NON-WIKI-NAMES-LIST.

   You can see the list of links of your document with `bhl-show-lol',
which is bound to <C-c C-/>.  You can insert the list of links of your
document with `bhl-insert-lol', which is bound to <C-c C-c l>.  *Note
The list of links::.

   You can browse URLs and WikiNames with `bhl-goto-next-url-or-wiki'
<C-TAB>. (*Note Browsing the BHL file::.)

3.5.2 Converting Links
----------------------

URLs are converted by the `bhl-convert-url' function and WikiNames are
converted by the `bhl-convert-wiki-names' function.  You can write your
URL as it is (`http://site.org'), or put it into square brackets to
define a label: `[[http://site.org][my site]]'.

   You can insert an URL with `bhl-insert-url', <C-c C-c h>: *Note
Commands and key bindings::.

   Here is a list of some URLs and their conversions into the HTML
format:

`http://site.org'
     <a href="http://site.org">http://site.org</a>

`url:mypage.html'
     <a href="mypage.html">mypage.html</a>

`[[http://site.org][SITE]]'
     <a href="http://site.org">SITE</a>

`mailto:bb@site.fr'
     <a href="mailto:bb@site.org>bb@site.org</a>

`[[mailto:bb@site.fr][BB]]'
     <a href="mailto:bb@site.org>BB</a>

   Here is a list of some URLs and their conversions into the LaTeX
format:

`http://site.org'
     \url{http://site.org}

`url:mypage.html'
     \url{mypage.html}

`[[http://site.org][SITE]'
     SITE (\url{http://site.org})

`mailto:bb@site.org'
     \url{bb@site.org}

`[[mailto:bb@site.org][BB]]'
     BB (\url{bb@site.org})

   Here is a list of some URLs and their conversions into the Texinfo
format:

`http://site.org'
     @uref{http://site.org}

`url:mypage.html'
     @uref{mypage.html}

`[[http://site.org][SITE]'
     @uref{http://site.org,SITE}

`mailto:bb@site.org'
     @uref{bb@site.org}

`[[mailto:bb@site.org][BB]]'
     @uref{bb@site.org,BB}

   Here is a list of some URLs and their conversions into the SGML
format:

`http://site.org'
     <HTMLURL URL="http://site.org" NAME="http://site.org">

`url:mypage.html'
     <HTMLURL URL="mypage.html" NAME="mypage.html">

`[[http://site.org][SITE]'
     <HTMLURL URL="http://site.org" NAME="SITE">

`mailto:bb@site.org'
     <HTMLURL URL="mailto:bb@site.org" NAME="mailto:bb@site.org">

`[[mailto:bb@site.org][BB]]'
     <HTMLURL URL="mailto:bb@site.org" NAME="BB">

   Here is a list of some URLs and their conversions into the TXT
format:

`http://site.org'
     http://site.org

`url:mypage.html'
     mypage.html

`[[http://site.org][SITE]'
     http://site.org (SITE)

`mailto:bb@fardeau.fr'
     bb@fardeau.fr

`[[mailto:bb@fardeau.fr][BB]]'
     bb@fardeau.fr (BB)

   In these examples, you can replace `http://' by `ftp://' or
`file:///'.  When using `[[...][...]]', a prefix like `http://' is not
mandatory.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Handling lists,  Next: Handling tables,  Prev: Handling links,  Up: The syntax

3.6 Handling lists
==================

bhl handles three kinds of lists: non-ordered lists, ordered lists and
descriptive (or definition) lists.

   A _non-ordered list item_ is defined by: some <TAB> at the beginning
of the line, a list separator among <`- * o'>, a whitespace.

   An _ordered list item_ is defined by: some <TAB> at the beginning of
the line, a number, a dot, a whitespace.

   A _definition list item_ is defined by: some <TAB> at the beginning
of the line, a term, a whitespace, two dashes, a whitespace.

   <TAB> inserts an indent-relative TAB, while <M-TAB> inserts a rigid
TAB mesuring exactly three columns.  Make sure that there is a
whitespace after a `*': no whitespace means that the next characters
may use bold font.

   bhl handles also nested lists, but no definition list can be nested.
To add a nested item, just add a TAB character relatively to the
previous item.  In each list, the first item indicates the kind:
ordered, non-ordered or definition list.

   Here is a table of lists separators:

`<TAB(S)>[*,-,o]<SPC>'
     item of a non-ordered list

`<TAB(S)>[0-9].<SPC>'
     item of an ordered list (enumerate)

`<TAB(S)>A term<SPC>--<SPC>'
     item of a definition list

   Take a look at the examples on `http://www.nongnu.org/bhl' for
further details.


File: bhl.info,  Node: Handling tables,  Next: Handling images,  Prev: Handling lists,  Up: The syntax

3.7 Handling tables
===================

Here is an example of a table:

      | @Name@  | @First name@  | @Age@  |
      | Jean    | Luc-Henri     | 123    |
      | Paul    | Matthieu      | 2      |

   The character `|' has three different functions: it begins a new
row, it seperates two cells, it ends a row.  Whitespaces and tab
characters are NOT allowed between the beginning of a new line and the
first `|'.

   Optional `@' around the cell content indicates that this cell is a
header. Typically, you put headers on the very first row of the table.
In the HTML output, a header cell is put into `<TH></TH>' tags. In
other LaTeX and SGML, the header line is separated from the rest of the
table by an horizontal rule.

   More details about the table options: *Note Converting tables::.

3.8 Handling images
===================

Here is an example of how to insert an image:

     [[image.jpg]]

   You can search for a particular file and insert it as an image with
<C-c C-c i>, wich is the default key binding for `bhl-insert-image'.

   Only `bhl2html' handles images.  Other conversion functions like
`bhl2sgml', `bhl2texinfo' or `bhl2latex' put images into comment
strings. `bhl2txt' erases images.

4 Properties of conversion
**************************

You may want to convert your bhl document without customizing anything.
This is OK.  But you surely want to control some properties of the
different conversion functions.  For example, you may decide that the
HTML conversion includes the table of contents, whereas the LaTeX
conversion doesn't.  You may want to calculate the `\date{...}' command
of the LaTeX output relatively to the current time.  You may want to
set up a different CSS style for a particular HTML output.  Etc.

   This section tells you how to do this.

File: bhl.info,  Node: Overview of properties,  Next: Specifications,  Prev: Properties of conversion,  Up: Properties of conversion

4.1 Overview of properties
==========================

The two important variables for the choice of conversions properties
are BHL-XXX-CONVERSIONS-LIST and BHL2XXX-PROPERTIES-LIST, where `xxx'
is the name of the conversion.  *Note Global options::.

   BHL-XXX-CONVERSIONS-LIST includes the detailed list of conversions
for each format.  Normally you should not change this variable too
often.

   BHL2XXX-PROPERTIES-LIST allows you to set global options for the
conversion.  These global options deal with the checking of dubious
tags, the insertion of the sections' prefix, the tables' captions, the
i18n conventions, the insertion of the table of contents and the
centering of sections/title (for the `bhl2txt' conversion.)  You can
change this variable by:

   - inserting a specification line inside your bhl document;

   - selecting the options from the menu;

   - modifying this variable with `M-x customize'.

   This order is important: the options set inside a specification line
will override the options set from the menu, which override those set
in the default customization.

   These global options are set to their default value (i.e. their
customized value) each time you run the `bhl-mode' command.  They are
also set to their default value after each conversion, except if you
remove the `bhl-initialize-properties' function from the
`bhl-after-conversion-hook' list.

4.2 Specifications
==================

bhl allows you to add some specification lines inside a document, so
that bhl handles _this_ document adequately.  Specifications concern
mainly two kind of properties: the properties of the document's header
and the conversion properties.  Here are some examples of specification
lines:

     #!html!prefix:check:caption:toc
     #!latex!noprefix:nocheck:nocaption:notoc
     #!date!It's %H:%M.

   In this example, the command `bhl2html' will insert the sections'
prefix, check for dubious tags, ask for a caption for each table and
insert the table of contents (also known as _toc_).  The command
`bhl2latex' WON'T insert the sections' prefix, check for dubious tags,
ask for a caption for each table and insert the toc.  The date will be
set to the current time (hours:minutes).  Quite simple, isn't it?

   A specification line is always a comment at the beginning of the
line.  It splits into two parts: a _prefix_, which is enclosed into two
exclamation marks, and the _labels_, which are separated by a column.
Each label can be turned off by adding `no-': `notoc' is the exact
opposite of `toc'.

   Here is a complete list of available specification prefix and their
relevant labels.

`#!author!'
     The name of the author for the current document.

`#!title!'
     The title of the document. This specification overrides any other
     title (the first line of the buffer or any `#!xxx-title!'
     specification).

`#!xxx-title!'
     The title of the document for the `xxx' conversion. `xxx' may be
     `html', `sgml', `texi' or `latex'. This specification is overriden
     by the `#!title!' specification, and overrides the first line of
     the buffer.

`#!subtitle!'
     The subtitle of the document.  The subtitle conversion is supported
     only for the HTML, Texinfo and TXT output.

`#!lang!'
     The language of the document.  This override the value of
     BHL-I18N-CONVENTIONS.  In the Texinfo output, it sets the value of
     `@documentlanguage'.

`#!encoding!'
     The encoding of the document.  This information is relevant for the
     Texinfo and HTML conversion.  In the Texinfo output, it sets the
     value of `@documentencoding'.  In the HTML output, it overrides the
     value of BHL-HTML-CONTENT-TYPE.

`#!date!'
     The date of the current document.  Since the column has no special
     meaning here, you can use the Emacs time-formatting conventions.
     For example, `#!date!%H:%M' will set `date' to the current time
     (hours:minutes). *note (Elisp)Time Conversion::.

`#!html!'
     The prefix concerning `bhl2html' specifications.  Here is a
     complete list of available labels:

    `toc'
          Insert the table of content in the LaTeX output.

`!#latex-class!'
     The class of the LaTeX output.

`#!latex-options!'
     The options of the chosen class.  You can insert as many options as
     you want, provided that you separate them with a column.

`#!latex-packages!'
     Some LaTeX packages and their options. For example :


          #!latex-packages!fontenc[T1]:[latin1]inputenc:babel[french]

          \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
          \usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
          \usepackage[french]{babel}

     The location of the square brackets doesn't matter.

5 Browsing your document
************************

The bhl mode comes with two commands that allows you to browse your
document: `bhl-show-toc' and `bhl-show-lol'.  The latter is not a joke:
it allows you to browse the list of links.  The former allows you to
browse the table of contents.  These two commands create a new buffer
turned into either `bhl-toc-mode' or `bhl-lol-mode'.

* Menu:

* The table of contents::       Show me the toc!
* The list of links::           Show me the lol!


File: bhl.info,  Node: The table of contents,  Next: The list of links,  Prev: Browsing your document,  Up: Browsing your document

5.1 The table of contents
=========================

The bhl mode enables you to update the numbering of sections of your
bhl file, to insert the table of contents into your bhl file, to browse
the table of contents in a new buffer.

   Two variables are required to handle the table of contents:
BHL-TOC-LOCATION and BHL-DEFAULT-TOC-DEPTH.  The first one defines the
location of the inserted toc.  You can change its value via the menu or
via `customize'.  The second one defines the default toc depth.

   You can insert the toc with `bhl-insert-toc' <C-c C-c t>. A numeric
argument defines the depth of this inserted toc.  You can also insert
the toc from the `*toc*' buffer with <i>.  From this buffer, the toc
depth is set to the depth of the currently displayed toc.

   When it converts the buffer, bhl first checks if there is a table of
contents.  If there is one, bhl inserts it in the output according to
the current toc location of the buffer.

* Menu:

* Browse the table of contents::  in a new buffer
* Insert the table of contents::  in the source file


File: bhl.info,  Node: Browse the table of contents,  Next: Insert the table of contents,  Prev: The table of contents,  Up: The table of contents

5.1.1 Browse the table of contents
----------------------------------

You can get a new buffer, named `*toc*', with a browsable table of
contents.  You can browse the toc via the menu or with the key binding
<C-c C-t>.  An optional numeric argument indicates the toc depth.

<?>
     Display a quick help for the `bhl-toc-mode'.

<q>
     Quit the `*toc*' buffer.

<n>
     Go to the next item.

<p>
     Go to the previous item.

<>>
     Go to the last item.

<<>
     Go to the first item.

<i>
     Insert the table of contents in your bhl file.

<1>
     Set the toc depth to 1.

<2>
     Set the toc depth to 2.

<3>
     Set the toc depth to 3.

5.1.2 Insert the table of contents
----------------------------------

You can insert the table of contents of your bhl file into itself with
<C-c C-c t>.  If a toc has already been inserted, this command only
updates the table of contents, leaving it to its current location.  If
a toc has not been inserted yet, this command inserts a new one
according to the value of BHL-TOC-LOCATION.  An optional numeric
argument indicates the toc depth.


File: bhl.info,  Node: The list of links,  Prev: The table of contents,  Up: Browsing your document

5.2 The list of links
=====================

You can see the list of links with `bhl-show-lol'.  The default key for
this command is <C-c C-/>.  A new buffer is created, named `*lol*' and
turned into the `bhl-lol-mode'.

   While moving inside this buffer, your document's buffer is updated so
that its point is set to the link you're currently pointing on.  You
can also visit the link you're pointing on with <RET> or <mouse-2>.

   Here is a list of the available commands inside the `bhl-lol-mode':

<?>
     Display a quick help for the `bhl-lol-mode'.

<q>
     Quit the `*lol*' buffer.

<n>
     Go to the next item/link.

<p>
     Go to the previous item/link.

<>>
     Go to the last item/link.

<<>
     Go to the first item/link.

7.1 Global options
==================

 -- User Option: bhl-mode-hook
     Hook run while in bhl mode.  If you are under GNU Emacs, it could
     be useful to add `footnote-mode', since bhl converts footnotes.

 -- User Option: bhl-after-conversion-hook
     Hook run at the very end of a conversion.  The default value is
     `bhl-initialize-properties'.  Adding `bhl-view-log' could also be
     useful.  If you remove this function, the conversion properties of
     the _last_ converted buffer will be the default conversion
     properties for the _next_ converted buffer - which may not be what
     tou really want.

 -- User Option: bhl-autoguess-style-flag
     If non-nil, autoguess the sectioning style.  When you find a file,
     BHL tries to guess its sectioning style and sets the value of
     `bhl-sectioning-default-style' to the value of the file's style.

     The default value of BHL-AUTOGUESS-STYLE-FLAG is `nil'.

 -- User Option: bhl-sectioning-default-style
     Define the style for the titles of sections, subsections and
     subsubsections. The five available styles are: numerical (`num'),
     alphabetical (`alpha'), asterisks (`aster'), equal-signs
     (`equal-signs') and your own style (`my'). *Note Sections::.

     If you want to use your own style, you have to define
     BHL-MY-SECTIONING-REGEXP-LIST. In this case, `bhl-update-toc' is
     not available anymore.

 -- User Option: bhl-my-sectioning-regexp-list
     A list of regular expressions that match the different levels of
     sectioning. They respectively match the prefix of a section's,
     subsection's and subsubsection's title. Since the titles of the
     sections are always put _at the beginning of the line_, you don't
     have to insert a `^' in these regular expressions.

     The default value of BHL-MY-SECTIONING-REGEXP-LIST is the value of
     BHL-MY-SECTIONING-REGEXP-LIST, which corresponds to the numerical
     style (`num')..

 -- User Option: bhl-verbatim-ignore
     A list of syntactic elements that shouldn't be converted when found
     inside a verbatim environment.  The default value of this variable
     is `(tag comment list description table url wikiname images
     special-char tex-label footnote quote)'.

 -- User Option: bhl-ignored-regexps
     A list of regexps. Each line matching a regexp within this list is
     automatically killed before any conversion.

 -- User Option: bhl-tags-overlap-flag
     Non-nil means that you can use tags on multiple lines.  Maybe
     useful to turn this option off is you want to use tags on multiple
     lines inside a verbatim environment.

 -- User Option: bhl-i18n-conventions
     The car of this variable is a language specification among
     `english', `french' and `german'.  bhl will follows conventions
     according to the chosen language.

     If the second element if t, bhl follows conventions concerning the
     punctuation, as defined in BHL-XX-PUNCTUATION (where `xx' is `en',
     `fr' or `de').

     If the third element if t, bhl follows conventions concerning the
     quotation marks, as defined in BHL-XX-QUOTATION-MARKS.

     If the fourth element if t, bhl follows conventions concerning
     special characters, as defined in BHL-XX-SPECIAL-CHARS.

 -- User Option: bhl-browse-url-function
     A function for calling your favorite browser.  The default value is
     `browse-url'.

     # This is the last example of a BHL file converted into HTML, LaTeX
     # and SGML formats.  This example shows you the various syntaxic rules
     # that BHL handles.  For further details, please refer to the manual
     # of the BHL mode. http://www.nongnu.org/bhl

     # These lines are comments.
     # You can comment a region with `bhl-comment-region'

     # The few next lines are specification lines. They
     # indicate the properties of the different conversions.

     This document is a small example of what BHL can do. For further
     details, please read the full documentation on

     #!texi-style!centered

     1. Fonts and environments

     1.1. Using font beautifiers

     Here is a list of the *different* fonts beautifiers that you can
     use inside the BHL mode.

     	Bold -- *one or two words.*
     	Emphasis -- _one or two words._
     	Truetype -- ==one or two words.==
     	Underline -- __one or two words.__
     	Bold italic -- _*one or two words*_.

     If want to insert an asterisk, you can use the escape character like
     \*this\* or like \_this\_. This is also available for \#comments.

     1.2. Environments

     BHL handles two specific environments: verbatim and minipage.

     Verbatim:

     --
     Here is a *part* of text that			will be displayed
     in 	verbatim	                         #a comment

     Please remark[1] that this environment has no syntactic rule, except
     you modify the variable bhl-verbatim-ignore.

     	* list are ignored

     And so do...

     	Item -- descriptions.

     And so do tables!

     | A | B |
     | C | D |

     And so do quote environments:

         blahblahblah
         blahblahblah

     Etc.
     --


     A minipage:

     %%%[12cm]
     This minipage (12cm) is centered without border.
     %%%

     <%%[10cm]
     This minipage (10cm) is put on the left without border.
     %%%

     >-%[8cm]
     This minipage (8cm) is put on the right with border.
     %%%

     A horizontal rule:

     ----[3cm]

     Another horizontal rule, put on the right:

     >---[3cm]

     2. Converting lists

     2.1. Ordered and non-ordered lists

     *Ordered* lists begin with three *whitespaces*, a list separator (\*, - or o)
     and another whitespace.

     	* Like this;
     	* or like that.

     2.2. Description lists

     Description lists are treated like other lists, except that they
     cannot be nested in other lists.

     A description item consists in tabs, a term to be defined, a
     whitespace, two dashes and another whitespace.

     	Term -- a definition of the terme.
     	Definition -- another definition.

     2.3. Nested lists

     	* Lists can be nested inside other lists.

     		* You just need to add three whitespaces more.
     		* These to items will be nested into two other items. sldkfj
     		  lskdjf lmmlkm

     			1. Three levels of nested lists are supported.
     			2. Four levels won't be very useful...

     	* Blank lines are not mandatory between items.

     3. Converting tables

     A WikiName.

     Here is a table:

     | @dHL et lqskdj@                |  @qsdqsdOolsqdf@      |
     | Free softxware                 |  bastien1@free.fr     |
     | With Emacs                     |  Without Emacs        |
     |  bastien                       |  Without Emacs        |

     A table line begins and ends with a "|".  Other "|" inside a line of
     the table separate two cells.  Arobases around the content of a cell
     mean that this cell is a header of the table.

     4. Browsing your document

     4.1. The table of content

     You can _browse_ the table of content, _insert_ it inside your
     document, and _update_ the numbering of sections.

     The default key binding for browsing the table of content is C-c
     C-t.

     You can also choose the style of sectioning and swith from one style
     to another. The style of this document is set to *num* (which is the
     default style) by the specification line above.

     4.2. The list of links

     The default key binding for browsing the list of links is C-c
     C-/. This creates a new buffer with a list of URLs or wikinames that
     you can follow.

BHL is somewhat related to `emacs-wiki.el' and `muse.el' and you should
have a look at them. They are more wiki-oriented than BHL and they can
be more convenient if you want to convert a lot of pages at the same
time. But basically they do the same job.
