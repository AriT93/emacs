1. What is BHL?

BHL is an Emacs mode that enables you to convert brut text files into
HTML, LaTeX and SGML files.  "BHL" is an acronym for: "from *B*rut to
*H*tml and *L*aTeX" (SGML and Texinfo were implemented later).

In order to convert TXT files into other formats, you need to use some
syntactical elements.  The purpose of this mode is to use the most
_invisible_ and _convenient_ syntax.  By *invisible syntax*, I mean
that the source file must be as readable as possible (like any TXT
file must be).  By *convenient syntax*, I mean that the syntax must
fit user's habits.

Here's a list of syntactical elements that BHL handles:

	* title, sections, subsections, subsubsections;
	* bold, emphasis, underlign, bold-italic;
	* lists (nested, ordered, non-ordered, description lists);
	* tables;
	* comments;
	* images (only in the html output);
	* URLs;
	* horizontal rules;
	* footnotes;
	* special chars;
	* quote, verbatim and minipage environments.

BHL handles also a _table of contents_: you can insert the table of
contents of the working file, browse the toc in a new buffer, and
update the numbering of sections with just one keystroke.

2. Install BHL

Edit the _Makefile_. Set the load-path of your elisp files, etc.

When you're ok with the _Makefile_, type in your shell:

	* ~$ make
	* ~$ make install
	* ~$ make info
	* ~$ make install-info
	* ~$ make pdf

You may have to edit the `dir' file in the info path.

This installation procedure will also install some scripts from the
`contrib' directory.  These scripts allow you to perform the core
conversion functions of BHL from a shell.  Thanks to D. Katz for these
contribs.
