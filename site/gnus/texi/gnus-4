10.7.2.5 Hooking New Back Ends Into Gnus
........................................

Having Gnus start using your new back end is rather easy--you just
declare it with the `gnus-declare-backend' functions.  This will enter
the back end into the `gnus-valid-select-methods' variable.

   `gnus-declare-backend' takes two parameters--the back end name and
an arbitrary number of "abilities".

   Here's an example:

     (gnus-declare-backend "nnchoke" 'mail 'respool 'address)

   The above line would then go in the `nnchoke.el' file.

   The abilities can be:

`mail'
     This is a mailish back end--followups should (probably) go via
     mail.

`post'
     This is a newsish back end--followups should (probably) go via
     news.

`post-mail'
     This back end supports both mail and news.

`none'
     This is neither a post nor mail back end--it's something completely
     different.

`respool'
     It supports respooling--or rather, it is able to modify its source
     articles and groups.

`address'
     The name of the server should be in the virtual server name.  This
     is true for almost all back ends.

`prompt-address'
     The user should be prompted for an address when doing commands like
     `B' in the group buffer.  This is true for back ends like `nntp',
     but not `nnmbox', for instance.

10.7.2.6 Mail-like Back Ends
............................

One of the things that separate the mail back ends from the rest of the
back ends is the heavy dependence by most of the mail back ends on
common functions in `nnmail.el'.  For instance, here's the definition
of `nnml-request-scan':

     (deffoo nnml-request-scan (&optional group server)
       (setq nnml-article-file-alist nil)
       (nnmail-get-new-mail 'nnml 'nnml-save-nov nnml-directory group))

   It simply calls `nnmail-get-new-mail' with a few parameters, and
`nnmail' takes care of all the moving and splitting of the mail.

   This function takes four parameters.

METHOD
     This should be a symbol to designate which back end is responsible
     for the call.

EXIT-FUNCTION
     This function should be called after the splitting has been
     performed.

TEMP-DIRECTORY
     Where the temporary files should be stored.

GROUP
     This optional argument should be a group name if the splitting is
     to be performed for one group only.

   `nnmail-get-new-mail' will call BACK-END`-save-mail' to save each
article.  BACK-END`-active-number' will be called to find the article
number assigned to this article.

   The function also uses the following variables:
BACK-END`-get-new-mail' (to see whether to get new mail for this back
end); and BACK-END`-group-alist' and BACK-END`-active-file' to generate
the new active file.  BACK-END`-group-alist' should be a group-active
alist, like this:

     (("a-group" (1 . 10))
      ("some-group" (34 . 39)))

10.7.3 Score File Syntax
------------------------

Score files are meant to be easily parseable, but yet extremely
mallable.  It was decided that something that had the same read syntax
as an Emacs Lisp list would fit that spec.

   Here's a typical score file:

     (("summary"
       ("win95" -10000 nil s)
       ("Gnus"))
      ("from"
       ("Lars" -1000))
      (mark -100))

   BNF definition of a score file:

     score-file      = "" / "(" *element ")"
     element         = rule / atom
     rule            = string-rule / number-rule / date-rule
     string-rule     = "(" quote string-header quote space *string-match ")"
     number-rule     = "(" quote number-header quote space *number-match ")"
     date-rule       = "(" quote date-header quote space *date-match ")"
     quote           = <ascii 34>
     string-header   = "subject" / "from" / "references" / "message-id" /
                       "xref" / "body" / "head" / "all" / "followup"
     number-header   = "lines" / "chars"
     date-header     = "date"
     string-match    = "(" quote <string> quote [ "" / [ space score [ "" /
                       space date [ "" / [ space string-match-t ] ] ] ] ] ")"
     score           = "nil" / <integer>
     date            = "nil" / <natural number>
     string-match-t  = "nil" / "s" / "substring" / "S" / "Substring" /
                       "r" / "regex" / "R" / "Regex" /
                       "e" / "exact" / "E" / "Exact" /
                       "f" / "fuzzy" / "F" / "Fuzzy"
     number-match    = "(" <integer> [ "" / [ space score [ "" /
                       space date [ "" / [ space number-match-t ] ] ] ] ] ")"
     number-match-t  = "nil" / "=" / "<" / ">" / ">=" / "<="
     date-match      = "(" quote <string> quote [ "" / [ space score [ "" /
                       space date [ "" / [ space date-match-t ] ] ] ] ")"
     date-match-t    = "nil" / "at" / "before" / "after"
     atom            = "(" [ required-atom / optional-atom ] ")"
     required-atom   = mark / expunge / mark-and-expunge / files /
                       exclude-files / read-only / touched
     optional-atom   = adapt / local / eval
     mark            = "mark" space nil-or-number
     nil-or-number   = "nil" / <integer>
     expunge         = "expunge" space nil-or-number
     mark-and-expunge = "mark-and-expunge" space nil-or-number
     files           = "files" *[ space <string> ]
     exclude-files   = "exclude-files" *[ space <string> ]
     read-only       = "read-only" [ space "nil" / space "t" ]
     adapt        = "adapt" [ space "ignore" / space "t" / space adapt-rule ]
     adapt-rule      = "(" *[ <string> *[ "(" <string> <integer> ")" ] ")"
     local           = "local" *[ space "(" <string> space <form> ")" ]
     eval            = "eval" space <form>
     space           = *[ " " / <TAB> / <NEWLINE> ]

   Any unrecognized elements in a score file should be ignored, but not
discarded.

   As you can see, white space is needed, but the type and amount of
white space is irrelevant.  This means that formatting of the score
file is left up to the programmer--if it's simpler to just spew it all
out on one looong line, then that's ok.

   The meaning of the various atoms are explained elsewhere in this
manual (*note Score File Format::).

10.7.4 Headers
--------------

Internally Gnus uses a format for storing article headers that
corresponds to the NOV format in a mysterious fashion.  One could
almost suspect that the author looked at the NOV specification and just
shamelessly _stole_ the entire thing, and one would be right.

   "Header" is a severely overloaded term.  "Header" is used in RFC
1036 to talk about lines in the head of an article (e.g., `From').  It
is used by many people as a synonym for "head"--"the header and the
body".  (That should be avoided, in my opinion.)  And Gnus uses a
format internally that it calls "header", which is what I'm talking
about here.  This is a 9-element vector, basically, with each header
(ouch) having one slot.

   These slots are, in order: `number', `subject', `from', `date',
`id', `references', `chars', `lines', `xref', and `extra'.  There are
macros for accessing and setting these slots--they all have predictable
names beginning with `mail-header-' and `mail-header-set-',
respectively.

   All these slots contain strings, except the `extra' slot, which
contains an alist of header/value pairs (*note To From Newsgroups::).


File: gnus,  Node: Ranges,  Next: Group Info,  Prev: Headers,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.5 Ranges
-------------

GNUS introduced a concept that I found so useful that I've started
using it a lot and have elaborated on it greatly.

   The question is simple: If you have a large amount of objects that
are identified by numbers (say, articles, to take a _wild_ example)
that you want to qualify as being "included", a normal sequence isn't
very useful.  (A 200,000 length sequence is a bit long-winded.)

   The solution is as simple as the question: You just collapse the
sequence.

     (1 2 3 4 5 6 10 11 12)

   is transformed into

     ((1 . 6) (10 . 12))

   To avoid having those nasty `(13 . 13)' elements to denote a
lonesome object, a `13' is a valid element:

     ((1 . 6) 7 (10 . 12))

   This means that comparing two ranges to find out whether they are
equal is slightly tricky:

     ((1 . 5) 7 8 (10 . 12))

   and

     ((1 . 5) (7 . 8) (10 . 12))

   are equal.  In fact, any non-descending list is a range:

     (1 2 3 4 5)

   is a perfectly valid range, although a pretty long-winded one.  This
is also valid:

     (1 . 5)

   and is equal to the previous range.

   Here's a BNF definition of ranges.  Of course, one must remember the
semantic requirement that the numbers are non-descending.  (Any number
of repetition of the same number is allowed, but apt to disappear in
range handling.)

     range           = simple-range / normal-range
     simple-range    = "(" number " . " number ")"
     normal-range    = "(" start-contents ")"
     contents        = "" / simple-range *[ " " contents ] /
                       number *[ " " contents ]

   Gnus currently uses ranges to keep track of read articles and article
marks.  I plan on implementing a number of range operators in C if The
Powers That Be are willing to let me.  (I haven't asked yet, because I
need to do some more thinking on what operators I need to make life
totally range-based without ever having to convert back to normal
sequences.)


File: gnus,  Node: Group Info,  Next: Extended Interactive,  Prev: Ranges,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.6 Group Info
-----------------

Gnus stores all permanent info on groups in a "group info" list.  This
list is from three to six elements (or more) long and exhaustively
describes the group.

   Here are two example group infos; one is a very simple group while
the second is a more complex one:

     ("no.group" 5 ((1 . 54324)))

     ("nnml:my.mail" 3 ((1 . 5) 9 (20 . 55))
                     ((tick (15 . 19)) (replied 3 6 (19 . 3)))
                     (nnml "")
                     ((auto-expire . t) (to-address . "ding@gnus.org")))

   The first element is the "group name"--as Gnus knows the group,
anyway.  The second element is the "subscription level", which normally
is a small integer.  (It can also be the "rank", which is a cons cell
where the `car' is the level and the `cdr' is the score.)  The third
element is a list of ranges of read articles.  The fourth element is a
list of lists of article marks of various kinds.  The fifth element is
the select method (or virtual server, if you like).  The sixth element
is a list of "group parameters", which is what this section is about.

   Any of the last three elements may be missing if they are not
required.  In fact, the vast majority of groups will normally only have
the first three elements, which saves quite a lot of cons cells.

   Here's a BNF definition of the group info format:

     info          = "(" group space ralevel space read
                     [ "" / [ space marks-list [ "" / [ space method [ "" /
                     space parameters ] ] ] ] ] ")"
     group         = quote <string> quote
     ralevel       = rank / level
     level         = <integer in the range of 1 to inf>
     rank          = "(" level "." score ")"
     score         = <integer in the range of 1 to inf>
     read          = range
     marks-lists   = nil / "(" *marks ")"
     marks         = "(" <string> range ")"
     method        = "(" <string> *elisp-forms ")"
     parameters    = "(" *elisp-forms ")"

   Actually that `marks' rule is a fib.  A `marks' is a `<string>'
consed on to a `range', but that's a bitch to say in pseudo-BNF.

   If you have a Gnus info and want to access the elements, Gnus offers
a series of macros for getting/setting these elements.

`gnus-info-group'
`gnus-info-set-group'
     Get/set the group name.

`gnus-info-rank'
`gnus-info-set-rank'
     Get/set the group rank (*note Group Score::).

`gnus-info-level'
`gnus-info-set-level'
     Get/set the group level.

`gnus-info-score'
`gnus-info-set-score'
     Get/set the group score (*note Group Score::).

`gnus-info-read'
`gnus-info-set-read'
     Get/set the ranges of read articles.

`gnus-info-marks'
`gnus-info-set-marks'
     Get/set the lists of ranges of marked articles.

`gnus-info-method'
`gnus-info-set-method'
     Get/set the group select method.

`gnus-info-params'
`gnus-info-set-params'
     Get/set the group parameters.

   All the getter functions take one parameter--the info list.  The
setter functions take two parameters--the info list and the new value.

   The last three elements in the group info aren't mandatory, so it
may be necessary to extend the group info before setting the element.
If this is necessary, you can just pass on a non-`nil' third parameter
to the three final setter functions to have this happen automatically.

10.7.7 Extended Interactive
---------------------------

Gnus extends the standard Emacs `interactive' specification slightly to
allow easy use of the symbolic prefix (*note Symbolic Prefixes::).
Here's an example of how this is used:

     (defun gnus-summary-increase-score (&optional score symp)
       (interactive (gnus-interactive "P\ny"))
       ...
       )

   The best thing to do would have been to implement `gnus-interactive'
as a macro which would have returned an `interactive' form, but this
isn't possible since Emacs checks whether a function is interactive or
not by simply doing an `assq' on the lambda form.  So, instead we have
`gnus-interactive' function that takes a string and returns values that
are usable to `interactive'.

   This function accepts (almost) all normal `interactive' specs, but
adds a few more.

`y'
     The current symbolic prefix--the `gnus-current-prefix-symbol'
     variable.

`Y'
     A list of the current symbolic prefixes--the
     `gnus-current-prefix-symbol' variable.

`A'
     The current article number--the `gnus-summary-article-number'
     function.

`H'
     The current article header--the `gnus-summary-article-header'
     function.

`g'
     The current group name--the `gnus-group-group-name' function.



File: gnus,  Node: Emacs/XEmacs Code,  Next: Various File Formats,  Prev: Extended Interactive,  Up: Gnus Reference Guide

10.7.8 Emacs/XEmacs Code
------------------------

While Gnus runs under Emacs, XEmacs and Mule, I decided that one of the
platforms must be the primary one.  I chose Emacs.  Not because I don't
like XEmacs or Mule, but because it comes first alphabetically.

   This means that Gnus will byte-compile under Emacs with nary a
warning, while XEmacs will pump out gigabytes of warnings while
byte-compiling.  As I use byte-compilation warnings to help me root out
trivial errors in Gnus, that's very useful.

   I've also consistently used Emacs function interfaces, but have used
Gnusey aliases for the functions.  To take an example:  Emacs defines a
`run-at-time' function while XEmacs defines a `start-itimer' function.
I then define a function called `gnus-run-at-time' that takes the same
parameters as the Emacs `run-at-time'.  When running Gnus under Emacs,
the former function is just an alias for the latter.  However, when
running under XEmacs, the former is an alias for the following function:

     (defun gnus-xmas-run-at-time (time repeat function &rest args)
       (start-itimer
        "gnus-run-at-time"
        `(lambda ()
           (,function ,@args))
        time repeat))

   This sort of thing has been done for bunches of functions.  Gnus does
not redefine any native Emacs functions while running under XEmacs--it
does this `defalias' thing with Gnus equivalents instead.  Cleaner all
over.

   In the cases where the XEmacs function interface was obviously
cleaner, I used it instead.  For example `gnus-region-active-p' is an
alias for `region-active-p' in XEmacs, whereas in Emacs it is a
function.

   Of course, I could have chosen XEmacs as my native platform and done
mapping functions the other way around.  But I didn't.  The performance
hit these indirections impose on Gnus under XEmacs should be slight.

10.7.9.1 Active File Format
...........................

The active file lists all groups available on the server in question.
It also lists the highest and lowest current article numbers in each
group.

   Here's an excerpt from a typical active file:

     soc.motss 296030 293865 y
     alt.binaries.pictures.fractals 3922 3913 n
     comp.sources.unix 1605 1593 m
     comp.binaries.ibm.pc 5097 5089 y
     no.general 1000 900 y

   Here's a pseudo-BNF definition of this file:

     active      = *group-line
     group-line  = group spc high-number spc low-number spc flag <NEWLINE>
     group       = <non-white-space string>
     spc         = " "
     high-number = <non-negative integer>
     low-number  = <positive integer>
     flag        = "y" / "n" / "m" / "j" / "x" / "=" group

10.7.9.2 Newsgroups File Format
...............................

The newsgroups file lists groups along with their descriptions.  Not all
groups on the server have to be listed,  and not all groups in the file
have to exist on the server.  The file is meant purely as information to
the user.

   The format is quite simple; a group name, a tab, and the description.
Here's the definition:

     newsgroups    = *line
     line          = group tab description <NEWLINE>
     group         = <non-white-space string>
     tab           = <TAB>
     description   = <string>

10.8 Emacs for Heathens
=======================

Believe it or not, but some people who use Gnus haven't really used
Emacs much before they embarked on their journey on the Gnus Love Boat.
If you are one of those unfortunates whom "`C-M-a'", "kill the region",
and "set `gnus-flargblossen' to an alist where the key is a regexp that
is used for matching on the group name" are magical phrases with little
or no meaning, then this appendix is for you.  If you are already
familiar with Emacs, just ignore this and go fondle your cat instead.

* Menu:

* Keystrokes::                  Entering text and executing commands.
* Emacs Lisp::                  The built-in Emacs programming language.

10.8.1 Keystrokes
-----------------

   * Q: What is an experienced Emacs user?

   * A: A person who wishes that the terminal had pedals.

   Yes, when you use Emacs, you are apt to use the control key, the
shift key and the meta key a lot.  This is very annoying to some people
(notably `vi'le users), and the rest of us just love the hell out of
it.  Just give up and submit.  Emacs really does stand for
"Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift", and not "Editing Macros", as you may
have heard from other disreputable sources (like the Emacs author).

   The shift keys are normally located near your pinky fingers, and are
normally used to get capital letters and stuff.  You probably use it all
the time.  The control key is normally marked "CTRL" or something like
that.  The meta key is, funnily enough, never marked as such on any
keyboard.  The one I'm currently at has a key that's marked "Alt",
which is the meta key on this keyboard.  It's usually located somewhere
to the left hand side of the keyboard, usually on the bottom row.

   Now, us Emacs people don't say "press the meta-control-m key",
because that's just too inconvenient.  We say "press the `C-M-m' key".
`M-' is the prefix that means "meta" and "C-" is the prefix that means
"control".  So "press `C-k'" means "press down the control key, and
hold it down while you press `k'".  "Press `C-M-k'" means "press down
and hold down the meta key and the control key and then press `k'".
Simple, ay?

   This is somewhat complicated by the fact that not all keyboards have
a meta key.  In that case you can use the "escape" key.  Then `M-k'
means "press escape, release escape, press `k'".  That's much more work
than if you have a meta key, so if that's the case, I respectfully
suggest you get a real keyboard with a meta key.  You can't live without
it.

10.8.2 Emacs Lisp
-----------------

Emacs is the King of Editors because it's really a Lisp interpreter.
Each and every key you tap runs some Emacs Lisp code snippet, and since
Emacs Lisp is an interpreted language, that means that you can configure
any key to run any arbitrary code.  You just, like, do it.

   Gnus is written in Emacs Lisp, and is run as a bunch of interpreted
functions.  (These are byte-compiled for speed, but it's still
interpreted.)  If you decide that you don't like the way Gnus does
certain things, it's trivial to have it do something a different way.
(Well, at least if you know how to write Lisp code.)  However, that's
beyond the scope of this manual, so we are simply going to talk about
some common constructs that you normally use in your `.emacs' file to
customize Gnus.

   If you want to set the variable `gnus-florgbnize' to four (4), you
write the following:

     (setq gnus-florgbnize 4)

   This function (really "special form") `setq' is the one that can set
a variable to some value.  This is really all you need to know.  Now
you can go and fill your `.emacs' file with lots of these to change how
Gnus works.

   If you have put that thing in your `.emacs' file, it will be read
and `eval'ed (which is lisp-ese for "run") the next time you start
Emacs.  If you want to change the variable right away, simply say `C-x
C-e' after the closing parenthesis.  That will `eval' the previous
"form", which is a simple `setq' statement here.

   Go ahead--just try it, if you're located at your Emacs.  After you
`C-x C-e', you will see `4' appear in the echo area, which is the
return value of the form you `eval'ed.

   Some pitfalls:

   If the manual says "set `gnus-read-active-file' to `some'", that
means:

     (setq gnus-read-active-file 'some)

   On the other hand, if the manual says "set `gnus-nntp-server' to
`nntp.ifi.uio.no'", that means:

     (setq gnus-nntp-server "nntp.ifi.uio.no")

   So be careful not to mix up strings (the latter) with symbols (the
former).  The manual is unambiguous, but it can be confusing.

Introduction
============

This is the Gnus Frequently Asked Questions list.

   Gnus is a Usenet Newsreader and Electronic Mail User Agent
implemented  as a part of Emacs. It's been around in some form for
almost a decade  now, and has been distributed as a standard part of
Emacs for much of  that time. Gnus 5 is the latest (and greatest)
incarnation. The  original version was called GNUS, and was written by
Masanobu UMEDA.   When autumn crept up in '94, Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
grew bored and  decided to rewrite Gnus.

   Its biggest strength is the fact that it is extremely  customizable.
It is somewhat intimidating at first glance, but  most of the
complexity can be ignored until you're ready to take  advantage of it.
If you receive a reasonable volume of e-mail  (you're on various
mailing lists), or you would like to read  high-volume mailing lists
but cannot keep up with them, or read  high volume newsgroups or are
just bored, then Gnus is what you  want.

   This FAQ was maintained by Justin Sheehy until March 2002. He  would
like to thank Steve Baur and Per Abrahamsen for doing a wonderful  job
with this FAQ before him. We would like to do the same - thanks,
Justin!

   If you have a Web browser, the official hypertext version is at:
`http://my.gnus.org/FAQ/'.   This version is much nicer than the
unofficial hypertext  versions that are archived at Utrecht, Oxford,
Smart Pages, Ohio  State, and other FAQ archives. See the resources
question below  if you want information on obtaining it in another
format.

   The information contained here was compiled with the assistance  of
the Gnus development mailing list, and any errors or  misprints are the
my.gnus.org team's fault, sorry.

Question 1.1:
.............

What is the latest version of Gnus?

   Answer:

   Jingle please: Gnus 5.10.0 is released, get it while it's  hot! As
well as the step in version number is rather  small, Gnus 5.10 has tons
of new features which you  shouldn't miss, however if you are cautious,
you might  prefer to stay with 5.8.8 respectively 5.9 (they are
basically the same) until some bugfix releases are out.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.2],  Next: [1.3],  Prev: [1.1],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation

Question 1.2:
.............

What's new in 5.10.0?

   Answer:

   First of all, you should have a look into the file  GNUS-NEWS in the
toplevel directory of the Gnus tarball,  there the most important
changes are listed. Here's a  short list of the changes I find
especially  important/interesting:

   *  Major rewrite of the Gnus agent, Gnus agent is now  active by
     default.

   *  Many new article washing functions for dealing with  ugly
     formatted articles.

   *  Anti Spam features.

   *  message-utils now included in Gnus.

   *  New format specifiers for summary lines, e.g. %B for  a complex
     trn-style thread tree.

Question 1.3:
.............

Where and how to get Gnus?

   Answer:

   The latest released version of Gnus isn't included in  Emacs 21 and
until now it also isn't available through the  package system of XEmacs
21.4, therefor you should get the  Gnus tarball from
`http://www.gnus.org/dist/gnus.tar.gz'  or via anonymous FTP from
`ftp://ftp.gnus.org/pub/gnus/gnus.tar.gz'.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.4],  Next: [1.5],  Prev: [1.3],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation

Question 1.4:
.............

What to do with the tarball now?

   Answer:

   Untar it via `tar xvzf gnus.tar.gz' and do the common  `./configure;
make; make install' circle.   (under MS-Windows either get the Cygwin
environment from  `http://www.cygwin.com'  which allows you to do
what's described above or unpack the  tarball with some packer (e.g.
Winace from  `http://www.winace.com')  and use the batch-file make.bat
included in the tarball to install  Gnus. If you don't want to (or
aren't allowed to) install Gnus  system-wide, you can install it in
your home directory and add the  following lines to your
~/.xemacs/init.el or ~/.emacs:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gnus/lisp")
     (if (featurep 'xemacs)
         (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list "/path/to/gnus/texi/")
       (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "/path/to/gnus/texi/"))

Make sure that you don't have any Gnus related stuff  before this line,
on MS Windows use something like  "C:/path/to/lisp" (yes, "/").

Question 1.5:
.............

Which version of Emacs do I need?

   Answer:

   Gnus 5.10.0 requires an Emacs version that is greater  than or equal
to Emacs 20.7 or XEmacs 21.1.


File: gnus,  Node: [1.6],  Prev: [1.5],  Up: FAQ 1 - Installation

Question 1.6:
.............

How do I run Gnus on both Emacs and XEmacs?

   Answer:

   You can't use the same copy of Gnus in both as the Lisp  files are
byte-compiled to a format which is different  depending on which Emacs
did the compilation. Get one copy  of Gnus for Emacs and one for XEmacs.

10.9.2 Startup / Group buffer
-----------------------------

* Menu:

* [2.1]::   Every time I start Gnus I get a message
            "Gnus auto-save file exists. Do you want to read it?",
            what does this mean and how to prevent it?
* [2.2]::   Gnus doesn't remember which groups I'm subscribed to, what's this?
* [2.3]::   How to change the format of the lines in Group buffer?

Question 2.1:
.............

Every time I start Gnus I get a message "Gnus auto-save  file exists.
Do you want to read it?", what does this mean  and how to prevent it?

   Answer:

   This message means that the last time you used Gnus, it  wasn't
properly exited and therefor couldn't write its  informations to disk
(e.g. which messages you read), you  are now asked if you want to
restore those informations  from the auto-save file.

   To prevent this message make sure you exit Gnus  via `q' in group
buffer instead of  just killing Emacs.


File: gnus,  Node: [2.2],  Next: [2.3],  Prev: [2.1],  Up: FAQ 2 - Startup / Group buffer

Question: 2.2
.............

Gnus doesn't remember which groups I'm subscribed to,  what's this?

   Answer:

   You get the message described in the q/a pair above while  starting
Gnus, right? It's an other symptom for the same  problem, so read the
answer above.


File: gnus,  Node: [2.3],  Next: [2.4],  Prev: [2.2],  Up: FAQ 2 - Startup / Group buffer

Question 2.3:
.............

How to change the format of the lines in Group buffer?

   Answer:

   You've got to tweak the value of the variable
gnus-group-line-format. See the manual node "Group Line  Specification"
for information on how to do this. An  example for this (guess from
whose .gnus :-)):


     (setq gnus-group-line-format "%P%M%S[%5t]%5y : %(%g%)\n")


File: gnus,  Node: [2.4],  Next: [2.5],  Prev: [2.3],  Up: FAQ 2 - Startup / Group buffer

Question 2.4:
.............

My group buffer becomes a bit crowded, is there a way to  sort my
groups into categories so I can easier browse  through them?

   Answer:

   Gnus offers the topic mode, it allows you to sort your  groups in,
well, topics, e.g. all groups dealing with  Linux under the topic
linux, all dealing with music under  the topic music and all dealing
with scottish music under  the topic scottish which is a subtopic of
music.

   To enter topic mode, just hit t while in Group buffer. Now  you can
use `T n' to create a topic  at point and `T m' to move a group to  a
specific topic. For more commands see the manual or the  menu. You
might want to include the %P specifier at the  beginning of your
gnus-group-line-format variable to have  the groups nicely indented.

Question 2.5:
.............

How to manually sort the groups in Group buffer? How to  sort the
groups in a topic?

   Answer:

   Move point over the group you want to move and  hit `C-k', now move
point to the  place where you want the group to be and  hit `C-y'.

Question 3.1:
.............

I just installed Gnus, started it via  `M-x gnus'  but it only says
"nntp (news) open error", what to do?

   Answer:

   You've got to tell Gnus where to fetch the news from. Read  the
documentation for information on how to do this. As a  first start, put
those lines in ~/.gnus:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.yourprovider.net"))
     (setq user-mail-address "you@yourprovider.net")
     (setq user-full-name "Your Name")

Question 3.2:
.............

I'm working under Windows and have no idea what ~/.gnus means.

   Answer:

   The ~/ means the home directory where Gnus and Emacs look for the
configuration files. However, you don't really need to know what this
means, it suffices that Emacs knows what it means :-) You can type `C-x
C-f ~/.gnus RET ' (yes, with the forward slash, even on Windows), and
Emacs will open the right file for you. (It will most likely be new,
and thus empty.)  However, I'd discourage you from doing so, since the
directory Emacs chooses will most certainly not be what you want, so
let's do it the correct way.  The first thing you've got to do is to
create a suitable directory (no blanks in directory name please) e.g.
`c:\myhome'. Then you must set the environment variable HOME to this
directory. To do this under Win9x or Me include the line


     SET HOME=C:\myhome

in your autoexec.bat and reboot. Under NT, 2000 and XP,  hit
Winkey+Pause/Break to enter system options (if it  doesn't work, go to
Control Panel -> System). There you'll  find the possibility to set
environment variables, create  a new one with name HOME and value
`c:\myhome', a reboot is  not necessary.

   Now to create ~/.gnus, say  `C-x C-f ~/.gnus RET C-x C-s'.   in
Emacs.

Question 3.3:
.............

My news server requires authentication, how to store  user name and
password on disk?

   Answer:

   Create a file ~/.authinfo which includes for each server a line like
this

     machine news.yourprovider.net login YourUserName password YourPassword

.  Make sure that the file isn't readable to others if you  work on a
OS which is capable of doing so. (Under Unix  say

     chmod 600 ~/.authinfo

in a shell.)

Question 3.4:
.............

Gnus seems to start up OK, but I can't find out how to  subscribe to a
group.

   Answer:

   If you know the name of the group say `U  name.of.group RET' in
group buffer (use the  tab-completion Luke). Otherwise hit ^ in group
buffer,  this brings you to the server buffer. Now place point (the
cursor) over the server which carries the group you want,  hit `RET',
move point to the group  you want to subscribe to and say `u'  to
subscribe to it.

Question 3.5:
.............

Gnus doesn't show all groups / Gnus says I'm not allowed to  post on
this server as well as I am, what's that?

   Answer:

   Some providers allow restricted anonymous access and full  access
only after authorization. To make Gnus send authinfo  to those servers
append

     force yes

to the line for those servers in ~/.authinfo.

Question 3.6:
.............

I want Gnus to fetch news from several servers, is this possible?

   Answer:

   Of course. You can specify more sources for articles in the
variable gnus-secondary-select-methods. Add something like  this in
~/.gnus:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
     	     '(nntp "news.yourSecondProvider.net"))
     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
     	     '(nntp "news.yourThirdProvider.net"))


File: gnus,  Node: [3.7],  Next: [3.8],  Prev: [3.6],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting messages

Question 3.7:
.............

And how about local spool files?

   Answer:

   No problem, this is just one more select method called  nnspool, so
you want this:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnspool ""))

Or this if you don't want an NNTP Server as primary news source:

     (setq gnus-select-method '(nnspool ""))

Gnus will look for the spool file in /usr/spool/news, if you  want
something different, change the line above to something like this:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
                  '(nnspool "" (nnspool-directory "/usr/local/myspoolddir")))

This sets the spool directory for this server only.   You might have to
specify more stuff like the program used  to post articles, see the
Gnus manual on how to do this.


File: gnus,  Node: [3.8],  Next: [3.9],  Prev: [3.7],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting messages

Question 3.8:
.............

OK, reading news works now, but I want to be able to read my mail  with
Gnus, too. How to do it?

   Answer:

   That's a bit harder since there are many possible sources  for mail,
many possible ways for storing mail and many  different ways for
sending mail. The most common cases are  these: 1: You want to read
your mail from a pop3 server and  send them directly to a SMTP Server
2: Some program like  fetchmail retrieves your mail and stores it on
disk from  where Gnus shall read it. Outgoing mail is sent by
Sendmail, Postfix or some other MTA. Sometimes, you even  need a
combination of the above cases.

   However, the first thing to do is to tell Gnus in which way  it
should store the mail, in Gnus terminology which back end  to use. Gnus
supports many different back ends, the most  commonly used one is nnml.
It stores every mail in one file  and is therefor quite fast. However
you might prefer a one  file per group approach if your file system has
problems with  many small files, the nnfolder back end is then probably
the  choice for you. To use nnml add the following to ~/.gnus:

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnml ""))

As you might have guessed, if you want nnfolder, it's

     (add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods '(nnfolder ""))

   Now we need to tell Gnus, where to get it's mail from. If  it's a
POP3 server, then you need something like this:

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(pop :server "pop.YourProvider.net"
                                         :user "yourUserName"
                                         :password "yourPassword")))

Make sure ~/.gnus isn't readable to others if you store  your password
there. If you want to read your mail from a  traditional spool file on
your local machine, it's

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(file :path "/path/to/spool/file")))

If it's a Maildir, with one file per message as used by  postfix, Qmail
and (optionally) fetchmail it's

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(maildir :path "/path/to/Maildir/"
                                             :subdirs ("cur" "new")))

And finally if you want to read your mail from several files  in one
directory, for example because procmail already split your  mail, it's

     (eval-after-load "mail-source"
       '(add-to-list 'mail-sources '(directory :path "/path/to/procmail-dir/"
                                               :suffix ".prcml"))

Where :suffix ".prcml" tells Gnus only to use files with the  suffix
.prcml.

   OK, now you only need to tell Gnus how to send mail. If you  want to
send mail via sendmail (or whichever MTA is playing  the role of
sendmail on your system), you don't need to do  anything. However, if
you want to send your mail to an  SMTP Server you need the following in
your ~/.gnus

     (setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)
     (setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "smtp.yourProvider.net")

Question 3.9:
.............

And what about IMAP?

   Answer:

   There are two ways of using IMAP with Gnus. The first one is  to use
IMAP like POP3, that means Gnus fetches the mail from  the IMAP server
and stores it on disk. If you want to do  this (you don't really want
to do this) add the following to  ~/.gnus

     (add-to-list 'mail-sources '(imap :server "mail.mycorp.com"
                                       :user "username"
                                       :pass "password"
                                       :stream network
                                       :authentication login
                                       :mailbox "INBOX"
                                       :fetchflag "\\Seen"))

You might have to tweak the values for stream and/or  authentification,
see the Gnus manual node "Mail Source  Specifiers" for possible values.

   If you want to use IMAP the way it's intended, you've got to  follow
a different approach. You've got to add the nnimap  back end to your
select method and give the information  about the server there.

     (add-to-list
      'gnus-secondary-select-methods
      '(nnimap "Give the baby a name"
     	  (nnimap-address "imap.yourProvider.net")
     	  (nnimap-port 143)
     	  (nnimap-list-pattern "archive.*")))

Again, you might have to specify how to authenticate to the  server if
Gnus can't guess the correct way, see the Manual  Node "IMAP" for
detailed information.

Question 3.10:
..............

At the office we use one of those MS Exchange servers, can I use  Gnus
to read my mail from it?

   Answer:

   Offer your administrator a pair of new running shoes for  activating
IMAP on the server and follow the instructions  above.


File: gnus,  Node: [3.11],  Prev: [3.10],  Up: FAQ 3 - Getting messages

Question 3.11:
..............

Can I tell Gnus not to delete the mails on the server it  retrieves via
POP3?

   Answer:

   First of all, that's not the way POP3 is intended to work,  if you
have the possibility, you should use the IMAP  Protocol if you want
your messages to stay on the  server. Nevertheless there might be
situations where you  need the feature, but sadly Gnus itself has no
predefined  functionality to do so.

   However this is Gnus county so there are possibilities to  achieve
what you want. The easiest way is to get an external  program which
retrieves copies of the mail and stores them  on disk, so Gnus can read
it from there. On Unix systems you  could use e.g. fetchmail for this,
on MS Windows you can use  Hamster, an excellent local news and mail
server.

   The other solution would be, to replace the method Gnus  uses to get
mail from POP3 servers by one which is capable  of leaving the mail on
the server. If you use XEmacs, get  the package mail-lib, it includes
an enhanced pop3.el,  look in the file, there's documentation on how to
tell  Gnus to use it and not to delete the retrieved mail. For  GNU
Emacs look for the file epop3.el which can do the same  (If you know
the home of this file, please send me an  e-mail). You can also tell
Gnus to use an external program  (e.g. fetchmail) to fetch your mail,
see the info node  "Mail Source Specifiers" in the Gnus manual on how
to do  it.

Question 4.1:
.............

When I enter a group, all read messages are gone. How to view them
again?

   Answer:

   If you enter the group by saying  `RET'  in summary buffer with
point over the group, only unread and ticked messages are loaded. Say
`C-u RET'  instead to load all available messages. If you want only the
e.g. 300 newest say  `C-u 300 RET'

   Loading only unread messages can be annoying if you have threaded
view enabled, say

     (setq gnus-fetch-old-headers 'some)

in ~/.gnus to load enough old articles to prevent teared threads,
replace 'some with t to load  all articles (Warning: Both settings
enlarge the amount of data which is  fetched when you enter a group and
slow down the process of entering a group).

   If you already use Gnus 5.10.0, you can say  `/o N'  In summary
buffer to load the last N messages, this feature is not available in
5.8.8

   If you don't want all old messages, but the parent of the message
you're just reading,  you can say `^', if you want to retrieve the
whole thread  the message you're just reading belongs to, `A T' is your
friend.

Question 4.2:
.............

How to tell Gnus to show an important message every time I  enter a
group, even when it's read?

   Answer:

   You can tick important messages. To do this hit  `u' while point is
in summary buffer  over the message. When you want to remove the mark,
hit  either `d' (this deletes the tick  mark and set's unread mark) or
`M c'  (which deletes all marks for the message).

Question 4.5:
.............

How can I change the headers Gnus displays by default at  the top of
the article buffer?

   Answer:

   The variable gnus-visible-headers controls which headers  are shown,
its value is a regular expression, header lines  which match it are
shown. So if you want author, subject,  date, and if the header exists,
Followup-To and MUA / NUA  say this in ~/.gnus:

     (setq gnus-visible-headers
           "^\\(From:\\|Subject:\\|Date:\\|Followup-To:\
     \\|X-Newsreader:\\|User-Agent:\\|X-Mailer:\\)")

Question 4.6:
.............

I'd like Gnus NOT to render HTML-mails but show me the  text part if

   Answer:

   Say

     (eval-after-load "mm-decode"
      '(progn
           (add-to-list 'mm-discouraged-alternatives "text/html")
           (add-to-list 'mm-discouraged-alternatives "text/richtext")))

in ~/.gnus. If you don't want HTML rendered, even if there's no text
alternative add

     (setq mm-automatic-display (remove "text/html" mm-automatic-display))

too.

Question 4.7:
.............

Can I use some other browser than w3 to render my HTML-mails?

   Answer:

   Only if you use Gnus 5.10.0 or younger. In this case you've got the
choice between w3, w3m, links, lynx and html2text, which  one is used
can be specified in the variable  mm-text-html-renderer, so if you want
links to render your  mail say

     (setq mm-text-html-renderer 'links)

Question 4.8:
.............

Is there anything I can do to make poorly formatted mails  more
readable?

   Answer:

   Gnus offers you several functions to "wash" incoming mail,  you can
find them if you browse through the menu, item Article->Washing. The
most  interesting ones are probably "Wrap long lines" (  `W w'  ),
"Decode ROT13" (  `W r'  ) and "Outlook Deuglify" which repairs the
dumb quoting used  by many users of Microsoft products (  `W Y f' gives
you full deuglify.   See `W Y C-h' or  have a look at the menus for
other deuglifications).   Outlook deuglify is only available since Gnus
5.10.0.


File: gnus,  Node: [4.9],  Next: [4.10],  Prev: [4.8],  Up: FAQ 4 - Reading messages

Question 4.9:
.............

Is there a way to automatically ignore posts by specific  authors or
with specific words in the subject? And can I  highlight more
interesting ones in some way?

   Answer:

   You want Scoring. Scoring means, that you define rules  which assign
each message an integer value. Depending on  the value the message is
highlighted in summary buffer (if  it's high, say +2000) or
automatically marked read (if the  value is low, say -800) or some
other action happens.

   There are basically three ways of setting up rules which assign  the
scoring-value to messages. The first and easiest way is to set  up
rules based on the article you are just reading. Say you're  reading a
message by a guy who always writes nonsense and you want  to ignore his
messages in the future. Hit  `L', to set up a rule which lowers the
score.   Now Gnus asks you which the criteria for lowering the Score
shall  be. Hit `?' twice to see all possibilities,  we want `a' which
means the author (the from  header). Now Gnus wants to know which kind
of matching we want.   Hit either `e' for an exact match or  `s' for
substring-match and delete afterwards  everything but the name to score
down all authors with the given  name no matter which email address is
used. Now you need to tell  Gnus when to apply the rule and how long it
should last, hit e.g.   `p' to apply the rule now and let it last
forever. If you want to raise the score instead of lowering it say  `I'
instead of `L'.

   You can also set up rules by hand. To do this say `V  f' in summary
buffer. Then you are asked for the name  of the score file, it's
name.of.group.SCORE for rules valid in  only one group or all.Score for
rules valid in all groups. See the  Gnus manual for the exact syntax,
basically it's one big list  whose elements are lists again. the first
element of those lists  is the header to score on, then one more list
with what to match,  which score to assign, when to expire the rule and
how to do the  matching. If you find me very interesting, you could
e.g. add the  following to your all.Score:

     (("references" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 500 nil s))
      ("message-id" ("hschmi22.userfqdn.rz-online.de" 999 nil s)))

This would add 999 to the score of messages written by me  and 500 to
the score of messages which are a (possibly  indirect) answer to a
message written by me. Of course  nobody with a sane mind would do this
:-)

   The third alternative is adaptive scoring. This means Gnus  watches
you and tries to find out what you find  interesting and what annoying
and sets up rules  which reflect this. Adaptive scoring can be a huge
help  when reading high traffic groups. If you want to activate
adaptive scoring say

     (setq gnus-use-adaptive-scoring t)

in ~/.gnus.

Question 4.10:
..............

How can I disable threading in some (e.g. mail-) groups, or  set other
variables specific for some groups?

   Answer:

   While in group buffer move point over the group and hit  `G c', this
opens a buffer where you  can set options for the group. At the bottom
of the buffer  you'll find an item that allows you to set variables
locally for the group. To disable threading enter  gnus-show-threads as
name of variable and nil as  value. Hit button done at the top of the
buffer when  you're ready.

Question 4.11:
..............

Can I highlight messages written by me and follow-ups to  those?

   Answer:

   Stop those "Can I ..." questions, the answer is always yes  in Gnus
Country :-). It's a three step process: First we  make faces
(specifications of how summary-line shall look  like) for those
postings, then we'll give them some  special score and finally we'll
tell Gnus to use the new  faces. You can find detailed instructions on
how to do it on  my.gnus.org

Question 4.12:
..............

The number of total messages in a group which Gnus  displays in group
buffer is by far to high, especially in  mail groups. Is this a bug?

   Answer:

   No, that's a matter of design of Gnus, fixing this would  mean
reimplementation of major parts of Gnus'  back ends. Gnus thinks
"highest-article-number -  lowest-article-number =
total-number-of-articles". This  works OK for Usenet groups, but if you
delete and move  many messages in mail groups, this fails. To cure the
symptom, enter the group via `C-u RET'  (this makes Gnus get all
messages), then  hit `M P b' to mark all messages and  then say `B m
name.of.group' to move  all messages to the group they have been in
before, they  get new message numbers in this process and the count is
right again (until you delete and move your mail to other  groups
again).

Question 4.13:
..............

I don't like the layout of summary and article buffer, how  to change
it? Perhaps even a three pane display?

   Answer:

   You can control the windows configuration by calling the  function
gnus-add-configuration. The syntax is a bit  complicated but explained
very well in the manual node  "Window Layout". Some popular examples:

   Instead 25% summary 75% article buffer 35% summary and 65%  article
(the 1.0 for article means "take the remaining  space"):

     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article (vertical 1.0
     		     (summary .35 point)
     		     (article 1.0))))

   A three pane layout, Group buffer on the left, summary  buffer
top-right, article buffer bottom-right:

     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(article
        (horizontal 1.0
     	       (vertical 25
     			 (group 1.0))
     	       (vertical 1.0
     			 (summary 0.25 point)
     			 (article 1.0)))))
     (gnus-add-configuration
      '(summary
        (horizontal 1.0
     	       (vertical 25
     			 (group 1.0))
     	       (vertical 1.0
     			 (summary 1.0 point)))))

Question 4.14:
..............

I don't like the way the Summary buffer looks, how to tweak it?

   Answer:

   You've got to play around with the variable
gnus-summary-line-format. It's value is a string of  symbols which
stand for things like author, date, subject  etc. A list of the
available specifiers can be found in the  manual node "Summary Buffer
Lines" and the often forgotten  node "Formatting Variables" and it's
sub-nodes. There  you'll find useful things like positioning the cursor
and  tabulators which allow you a summary in table form, but  sadly
hard tabulators are broken in 5.8.8.

   Since 5.10.0, Gnus offers you some very nice new specifiers,  e.g.
%B which draws a thread-tree and %&user-date which  gives you a date
where the details are dependent of the  articles age. Here's an example
which uses both:

     (setq gnus-summary-line-format
           ":%U%R %B %s %-60=|%4L |%-20,20f |%&user-date; \n")

Question 4.15:
..............

How to split incoming mails in several groups?

   Answer:

   Gnus offers two possibilities for splitting mail, the easy
nnmail-split-methods and the more powerful Fancy Mail  Splitting. I'll
only talk about the first one, refer to  the manual, node "Fancy Mail
Splitting" for the latter.

   The value of nnmail-split-methods is a list, each element  is a list
which stands for a splitting rule. Each rule has  the form "group where
matching articles should go to",  "regular expression which has to be
matched", the first  rule which matches wins. The last rule must always
be a  general rule (regular expression .*) which denotes where
articles should go which don't match any other rule. If  the folder
doesn't exist yet, it will be created as soon  as an article lands
there. By default the mail will be  send to all groups whose rules
match. If you  don't want that (you probably don't want), say

     (setq nnmail-crosspost nil)

in ~/.gnus.

   An example might be better than thousand words, so here's  my
nnmail-split-methods. Note that I send duplicates in a  special group
and that the default group is spam, since I  filter all mails out which
are from some list I'm  subscribed to or which are addressed directly
to me  before. Those rules kill about 80% of the Spam which  reaches me
(Email addresses are changed to prevent spammers  from using them):

     (setq nnmail-split-methods
       '(("duplicates" "^Gnus-Warning:.*duplicate")

Question 5.1:
.............

What are the basic commands I need to know for sending mail and
postings?

   Answer:

   To start composing a new mail hit `m'  either in Group or Summary
buffer, for a posting, it's  either `a' in Group buffer and  filling
the Newsgroups header manually  or `a' in the Summary buffer of the
group where the posting shall be send to. Replying by mail  is  `r' if
you don't want to cite the  author, or import the cited text manually
and  `R' to cite the text of the original  message. For a follow up to
a newsgroup, it's  `f' and `F'  (analog to `r' and  `R'.

   Enter new headers above the line saying "-text follows  this line-",
enter the text below the line. When ready  hit `C-c C-c', to send the
message,  if you want to finish it later hit `C-c  C-d' to save it in
the drafts group, where you  can start editing it again by saying `D
e'.

Question 5.2:
.............

How to enable automatic word-wrap when composing messages?

   Answer:

   Say

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook
           (lambda ()
                (setq fill-column 72)
                (turn-on-auto-fill)))

in ~/.gnus. You can reformat a paragraph by hitting  `M-q' (as usual)


File: gnus,  Node: [5.3],  Next: [5.4],  Prev: [5.2],  Up: FAQ 5 - Composing messages

Question 5.3:
.............

How to set stuff like From, Organization, Reply-To, signature...?

   Answer:

   There are other ways, but you should use posting styles  for this.
(See below why).   This example should make the syntax clear:

     (setq gnus-posting-styles
       '((".*"
          (name "Frank Schmitt")
          (address "me@there.bla")
          (organization "Hamme net, kren mer och nimmi")
          (signature-file "~/.signature")
          ("X-SampleHeader" "foobar")
          (eval (setq some-variable "Foo bar")))))

The ".*" means that this settings are the default ones  (see below),
valid values for the first element of the  following lists are
signature, signature-file,  organization, address, name or body. The
attribute name  can also be a string. In that case, this will be used as
a header name, and the value will be inserted in the  headers of the
article; if the value is `nil', the header  name will be removed. You
can also say (eval (foo bar)),  then the function foo will be evaluated
with argument bar  and the result will be thrown away.


File: gnus,  Node: [5.4],  Next: [5.5],  Prev: [5.3],  Up: FAQ 5 - Composing messages

Question 5.4:
.............

Can I set things like From, Signature etc group based on the group I
post too?

   Answer:

   That's the strength of posting styles. Before, we used ".*"  to set
the default for all groups. You can use a regexp  like "^gmane" and the
following settings are only applied  to postings you send to the gmane
hierarchy, use  ".*binaries" instead and they will be applied to
postings  send to groups containing the string binaries in their  name
etc.

   You can instead of specifying a regexp specify a function  which is
evaluated, only if it returns true, the  corresponding settings take
effect. Two interesting  candidates for this are message-news-p which
returns t if  the current Group is a newsgroup and the corresponding
message-mail-p.

   Note that all forms that match are applied, that means in  the
example below, when I post to  gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general,
the settings under  ".*" are applied and the settings under
message-news-p and  those under "^gmane" and those under
"^gmane\\.mail\\.spam\\.spamassassin\\.general$". Because  of this put
general settings at the top and specific ones  at the bottom.

     (setq gnus-posting-styles
       '((".*"  ;;default
          (name "Frank Schmitt")
          (organization "Hamme net, kren mer och nimmi")
          (signature-file "~/.signature"))
         ((message-news-p)  ;;Usenet news?
          (address "mySpamTrap@Frank-Schmitt.bla")
          ("Reply-To" "hereRealRepliesOnlyPlease@Frank-Schmitt.bla"))
         ((message-mail-p)  ;;mail?
          (address "usedForMails@Frank-Schmitt.bla"))
         ("^gmane" ;;this is mail, too in fact
          (address "usedForMails@Frank-Schmitt.net")
          ("Reply-To" nil))
         ("^gmane.mail.spam.spamassassin.general$"
          (eval (setq mail-envelope-from "Azzrael@rz-online.de"))
          (address "Azzrael@rz-online.de"))))

Question 5.5:
.............

Is there a spell-checker? Perhaps even on-the-fly spell-checking?

   Answer:

   You can use ispell.el to spell-check stuff in Emacs. So the first
thing to do is to make sure that you've got either
   * ispell (http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/fmg-members/geoff/ispell.html)
     or

   * aspell (http://aspell.sourceforge.net/)
   installed and in your Path.

   Then you need ispell.el and for on-the-fly spell-checking
flyspell.el.  Ispell.el is shipped with Gnus Emacs and available
through the Emacs package system, flyspell.el is shipped with Emacs and
part of XEmacs text-modes package which is available through the
package system, so there should be no need to install them manually.

   Ispell.el assumes you use ispell, if you choose aspell say

     (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")

in your Emacs configuration file.

   If you want your outgoing messages to be spell-checked, say

     (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'ispell-message)

In your ~/.gnus, if you prefer on-the-fly spell-checking say

     (add-hook 'message-mode-hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode 1)))

Question 5.6:
.............

Can I set the dictionary based on the group I'm posting to?

   Answer:

   Yes, say something like

     (add-hook 'gnus-select-group-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (cond
                  ((string-match
                    "^de\\." (gnus-group-real-name gnus-newsgroup-name))
                   (ispell-change-dictionary "deutsch8"))
                  (t
                   (ispell-change-dictionary "english")))))

in ~/.gnus. Change "^de\\." and "deutsch8" to something  that suits
your needs.

Question 5.7:
.............

Is there some kind of address-book, so I needn't remember  all those
email addresses?

   Answer:

   There's an very basic solution for this, mail aliases.   You can
store your mail addresses in a ~/.mailrc file using a simple  alias
syntax:

     alias al	"Al <al@english-heritage.bla>"

Then typing your alias (followed by a space or punctuation  character)
on a To: or Cc: line in the message buffer will  cause Gnus to insert
the full address for you. See the  node "Mail Aliases" in Message (not
Gnus) manual for  details.

   However, what you really want is the Insidious Big Brother  Database
bbdb. Get it through the XEmacs package system or from  bbdb's homepage
(http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/).   Now place the following in ~/.gnus,
to activate bbdb for Gnus:

     (require 'bbdb)
     (bbdb-initialize 'gnus 'message)

Now you probably want some general bbdb configuration,  place them in
~/.emacs:

     (require 'bbdb)
     ;;If you don't live in Northern America, you should disable the
     ;;syntax check for telephone numbers by saying
     (setq bbdb-north-american-phone-numbers-p nil)
     ;;Tell bbdb about your email address:
     (setq bbdb-user-mail-names
           (regexp-opt '("Your.Email@here.bla"
                         "Your.other@mail.there.bla")))
     ;;cycling while completing email addresses
     (setq bbdb-complete-name-allow-cycling t)
     ;;No popup-buffers
     (setq bbdb-use-pop-up nil)

Now you should be ready to go. Say `M-x bbdb RET  RET' to open a bbdb
buffer showing all  entries. Say `c' to create a new  entry, `b' to
search your BBDB and  `C-o' to add a new field to an  entry. If you
want to add a sender to the BBDB you can  also just hit `:' on the
posting in the summary buffer and  you are done. When you now compose a
new mail,  hit `TAB' to cycle through know  recipients.

Question 5.8:
.............

Sometimes I see little images at the top of article  buffer. What's
that and how can I send one with my  postings, too?

   Answer:

   Those images are called X-Faces. They are 48*48 pixel b/w  pictures,
encoded in a header line. If you want to include  one in your posts,
you've got to convert some image to a  X-Face. So fire up some image
manipulation program (say  Gimp), open the image you want to include,
cut out the  relevant part, reduce color depth to 1 bit, resize to
48*48 and save as bitmap. Now you should get the compface  package from
this site (ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/faces/).   and create the
actual X-face by saying

     cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon |compface > file.face
     cat ./file.face | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' | sed 's/\"/\\\"/g' > ./file.face.quoted

If you can't use compface, there's an online X-face converter at
`http://www.dairiki.org/xface/'.  If you use MS Windows, you could also
use the WinFace program from `http://www.xs4all.nl/~walterln/winface/'.

   Now you only have to tell Gnus to include the X-face in your postings
by saying

     (setq message-default-headers
             (with-temp-buffer
               (insert "X-Face: ")
               (insert-file-contents "~/.xemacs/xface")
               (buffer-string)))

in ~/.gnus.

Question 5.9:
.............

Sometimes I accidentally hit r instead of f in  newsgroups. Can Gnus
warn me, when I'm replying by mail in  newsgroups?

   Answer:

   Put this in ~/.gnus:

     (setq gnus-confirm-mail-reply-to-news t)

if you already use Gnus 5.10.0, if you still use 5.8.8 or  5.9 try this
instead:

     (defadvice gnus-summary-reply (around reply-in-news activate)
            (interactive)
             (when (or (not (gnus-news-group-p gnus-newsgroup-name))
                       (y-or-n-p "Really reply? "))

Question 5.10:
..............

How to tell Gnus not to generate a sender header?

   Answer:

   Since 5.10.0 Gnus doesn't generate a sender header by  default. For
older Gnus' try this in ~/.gnus:

     (eval-after-load "message"
           '(add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled)))

Question 5.11:
..............

I want gnus to locally store copies of my send mail and  news, how to
do it?

   Answer:

   You must set the variable gnus-message-archive-group to do  this.
You can set it to a string giving the name of the  group where the
copies shall go or like in the example  below use a function which is
evaluated and which returns  the group to use.

     (setq gnus-message-archive-group
     	'((if (message-news-p)
     	      "nnml:Send-News"
     	    "nnml:Send-Mail")))

Question 5.12:
..............

People tell me my Message-IDs are not correct, why  aren't they and how
to fix it?

   Answer:

   The message-ID is an unique identifier for messages you  send. To
make it unique, Gnus need to know which machine  name to put after the
"@". If the name of the machine  where Gnus is running isn't suitable
(it probably isn't  at most private machines) you can tell Gnus what to
use  by saying
     (setq message-user-fqdn "yourmachine.yourdomain.tld")
   in ~/.gnus.  If you use Gnus 5.9 or ealier, you can use this instead:
     (eval-after-load "message"
       '(let (myfqdn "yourmachine.yourdomain.tld");; <-- Edit this!
          (if (boundp 'message-user-fqdn)
              (setq message-user-fqdn fqdn)
            (gnus-message 1 "Redefining `message-make-fqdn'.")
            (defun message-make-fqdn ()
              "Return user's fully qualified domain name."
              fqdn))))

   If you have no idea what to insert for
"yourmachine.yourdomain.tld", you've got several  choices. You can
either ask your provider if he allows  you to use something like
yourUserName.userfqdn.provider.net, or you can use
somethingUnique.yourdomain.tld if you own the domain  yourdomain.tld,
or you can register at a service which  gives private users a FQDN for
free, e.g.   `http://www.stura.tu-freiberg.de/~dlx/addfqdn.html'.
(Sorry but this website is in German, if you know of an  English one
offering the same, drop me a note).

   Finally you can tell Gnus not to generate a Message-ID  for News at
all (and letting the server do the job) by saying

     (setq message-required-news-headers
       (remove' Message-ID message-required-news-headers))

you can also tell Gnus not to generate Message-IDs for mail by saying

     (setq message-required-mail-headers
       (remove' Message-ID message-required-mail-headers))

, however some mail servers don't generate proper  Message-IDs, too, so
test if your Mail Server behaves  correctly by sending yourself a Mail
and looking at the Message-ID.

Question 6.1:
.............

How to import my old mail into Gnus?

   Answer:

   The easiest way is to tell your old mail program to  export the
messages in mbox format. Most Unix mailers  are able to do this, if you
come from the MS Windows  world, you may find tools at
`http://mbx2mbox.sourceforge.net/'.

   Now you've got to import this mbox file into Gnus. To do  this,
create a nndoc group based on the mbox file by  saying `G f
/path/file.mbox RET' in  Group buffer. You now have read-only access to
your  mail. If you want to import the messages to your normal  Gnus
mail groups hierarchy, enter the nndoc group you've  just created by
saying `C-u RET'  (thus making sure all messages are retrieved), mark
all  messages by saying `M P b' and  either copy them to the desired
group by saying  `B c name.of.group RET' or send them  through
nnmail-split-methods (respool them) by saying  `B r'.

How to archive interesting messages?

   Answer:

   If you stumble across an interesting message, say in  gnu.emacs.gnus
and want to archive it there are several  solutions. The first and
easiest is to save it to a file  by saying `O f'. However, wouldn't  it
be much more convenient to have more direct access to  the archived
message from Gnus? If you say yes, put this  snippet by Frank Haun
<pille3003@fhaun.de> in  ~/.gnus:

     (defun my-archive-article (&optional n)
       "Copies one or more article(s) to a corresponding `nnml:' group, e.g.
     `gnus.ding' goes to `nnml:1.gnus.ding'. And `nnml:List-gnus.ding' goes
     to `nnml:1.List-gnus-ding'.

     Use process marks or mark a region in the summary buffer to archive
     more then one article."
       (interactive "P")
       (let ((archive-name
              (format

                 (replace-regexp-in-string "^.*:" "" gnus-newsgroup-name)))))
         (gnus-summary-copy-article n archive-name)))

You can now say `M-x  my-archive-article' in summary buffer to  archive
the article under the cursor in a nnml  group. (Change nnml to your
preferred back end)

   Of course you can also make sure the cache is enabled by saying

     (setq gnus-use-cache t)

then you only have to set either the tick or the dormant  mark for
articles you want to keep, setting the read  mark will remove them from
cache.

Question 6.3:
.............

How to search for a specific message?

   Answer:

   There are several ways for this, too. For a posting from  a Usenet
group the easiest solution is probably to ask  groups.google.com
(http://groups.google.com),  if you found the posting there, tell
Google to display  the raw message, look for the message-id, and say
`M-^ the@message.id RET' in a  summary buffer.   Since Gnus 5.10.0
there's also a Gnus interface for  groups.google.com which you can call
with  `G W') in group buffer.

   Another idea which works for both mail and news groups  is to enter
the group where the message you are  searching is and use the standard
Emacs search  `C-s', it's smart enough to look at  articles in
collapsed threads, too. If you want to  search bodies, too try `M-s'
instead. Further on there are the  gnus-summary-limit-to-foo functions,
which can help you,  too.

   Of course you can also use grep to search through your  local mail,
but this is both slow for big archives and  inconvenient since you are
not displaying the found mail  in Gnus. Here comes nnir into action.
Nnir is a front end  to search engines like swish-e or swish++ and
others. You index your mail with one of those search  engines and with
the help of nnir you can search trough  the indexed mail and generate a
temporary group with all  messages which met your search criteria. If
this sound  cool to you get nnir.el from
`ftp://ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de/pub/src/emacs/'  or
`ftp://ftp.is.informatik.uni-duisburg.de/pub/src/emacs/'.
Instructions on how to use it are at the top of the file.

Question 6.4:
.............

How to get rid of old unwanted mail?

   Answer:

   You can of course just mark the mail you don't need  anymore by
saying `#' with point  over the mail and then say `B DEL'  to get rid
of them forever. You could also instead of  actually deleting them,
send them to a junk-group by  saying `B m nnml:trash-bin' which  you
clear from time to time, but both are not the intended  way in Gnus.

   In Gnus, we let mail expire like news expires on a news  server.
That means you tell Gnus the message is  expirable (you tell Gnus "I
don't need this mail  anymore") by saying `E' with point  over the mail
in summary buffer. Now when you leave the  group, Gnus looks at all
messages which you marked as  expirable before and if they are old
enough (default is  older than a week) they are deleted.

Question 6.5:
.............

I want that all read messages are expired (at least in  some groups).
How to do it?

   Answer:

   If you want all read messages to be expired (e.g. in  mailing lists
where there's an online archive), you've  got two choices: auto-expire
and  total-expire. Auto-expire means, that every article  which has no
marks set and is selected for reading is  marked as expirable, Gnus
hits `E'  for you every time you read a message. Total-expire  follows
a slightly different approach, here all article  where the read mark is
set are expirable.

   To activate auto-expire, include auto-expire in the  Group
parameters for the group. (Hit `G  c' in summary buffer with point over
the  group to change group parameters). For total-expire add
total-expire to the group-parameters.

   Which method you choose is merely a matter of taste:  Auto-expire is
faster, but it doesn't play together with  Adaptive Scoring, so if you
want to use this feature,  you should use total-expire.

   If you want a message to be excluded from expiration in  a group
where total or auto expire is active, set either  tick (hit `u') or
dormant mark (hit  `u'), when you use auto-expire, you  can also set
the read mark (hit  `d').

Question 6.6:
.............

I don't want expiration to delete my mails but to move them  to another
group.

   Answer:

   Say something like this in ~/.gnus:

     (setq nnmail-expiry-target "nnml:expired")

(If you want to change the value of nnmail-expiry-target  on a per
group basis see the question "How can I disable  threading in some
(e.g. mail-) groups, or set other  variables specific for some groups?")

Question 7.1:
.............

I don't have a permanent connection to the net, how can  I minimize the
time I've got to be connected?

   Answer:

   You've got basically two options: Either you use the  Gnus Agent
(see below) for this, or you can install  programs which fetch your
news and mail to your local  disk and Gnus reads the stuff from your
local  machine.

   If you want to follow the second approach, you need a  program which
fetches news and offers them to Gnus, a  program which does the same
for mail and a program which  receives the mail you write from Gnus and
sends them  when you're online.

   Let's talk about Unix systems first: For the news part, the easiest
solution is a small nntp server like Leafnode
(http://www.leafnode.org/) or sn (http://infa.abo.fi/~patrik/sn/), of
course you can also install a full featured news server like inn
(http://www.isc.org/products/INN/).

   Then you want to fetch your Mail, popular choices are
   * fetchmail (http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/) and

   * getmail (http://www.qcc.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-3.0/).
   You should tell those to write the mail to your disk and Gnus to read
it from there. Last but not least the mail sending part: This can be
done with every MTA like sendmail (http://www.sendmail.org/), postfix
(http://www.qmail.org/), exim (http://www.exim.org/) or qmail
(http://www.qmail.org/).

   On windows boxes I'd vote for  Hamster (http://www.tglsoft.de/),
it's a small freeware, open-source program which fetches  your mail and
news from remote servers and offers them  to Gnus (or any other mail
and/or news reader) via nntp  respectively POP3 or IMAP. It also
includes a smtp  server for receiving mails from Gnus.

Question 7.2:
.............

So what was this thing about the Agent?

   Answer:

   The Gnus agent is part of Gnus, it allows you to fetch  mail and
news and store them on disk for reading them  later when you're
offline. It kind of mimics offline  newsreaders like e.g. Forte Agent.
If you want to use  the Agent place the following in ~/.gnus if you are
still using 5.8.8 or 5.9 (it's the default since 5.10.0):

     (setq gnus-agent t)

   Now you've got to select the servers whose groups can be  stored
locally. To do this, open the server buffer  (that is press `^' while
in the  group buffer). Now select a server by moving point to  the line
naming that server. Finally, agentize the  server by typing `J a'. If
you  make a mistake, or change your mind, you can undo this  action by
typing `J r'. When  you're done, type 'q' to return to the group buffer.
Now the next time you enter a group on a agentized  server, the
headers will be stored on disk and read from  there the next time you
enter the group.


File: gnus,  Node: [7.3],  Next: [7.4],  Prev: [7.2],  Up: FAQ 7 - Gnus in a dial-up environment

Question 7.3:
.............

I want to store article bodies on disk, too. How to do it?

   Answer:

   You can tell the agent to automatically fetch the bodies  of
articles which fulfill certain predicates, this is  done in a special
buffer which can be reached by  saying `J c' in group  buffer. Please
refer to the documentation for  information which predicates are
possible and how  exactly to do it.

   Further on you can tell the agent manually which  articles to store
on disk. There are two ways to do  this: Number one: In the summary
buffer, process mark a  set of articles that shall be stored in the
agent by  saying `#' with point over the  article and then type `J s'.
The  other possibility is to set, again in the summary  buffer,
downloadable (%) marks for the articles you  want by typing `@' with
point over  the article and then typing `J u'.   What's the difference?
Well, process marks are erased as  soon as you exit the summary buffer
while downloadable  marks are permanent. You can actually set
downloadable  marks in several groups then use fetch session ('J s' in
the GROUP buffer) to fetch all of those articles. The  only downside is
that fetch session also fetches all of  the headers for every selected
group on an agentized  server. Depending on the volume of headers, the
initial  fetch session could take hours.

Question 7.4:
.............

How to tell Gnus not to try to send mails / postings  while I'm offline?

   Answer:

   All you've got to do is to tell Gnus when you are online  (plugged)
and when you are offline (unplugged), the rest  works automatically.
You can toggle plugged/unplugged  state by saying `J j' in group
buffer. To start Gnus unplugged say `M-x  gnus-unplugged' instead of
`M-x gnus'. Note that for this to  work, the agent must be active.

How to find information and help inside Emacs?

   Answer:

   The first stop should be the Gnus manual (Say  `C-h i d m Gnus RET'
to start the  Gnus manual, then walk through the menus or do a
full-text search with `s'). Then  there are the general Emacs help
commands starting with  C-h, type `C-h ? ?' to get a list  of all
available help commands and their meaning. Finally  `M-x
apropos-command' lets you  search through all available functions and
`M-x  apropos' searches the bound variables.

Question 8.2:
.............

I can't find anything in the Gnus manual about X  (e.g. attachments,
PGP, MIME...), is it not documented?

   Answer:

   There's not only the Gnus manual but also the manuals  for message,
emacs-mime, sieve and pgg. Those packages  are distributed with Gnus
and used by Gnus but aren't  really part of core Gnus, so they are
documented in  different info files, you should have a look in those
manuals, too.

list (ding@gnus.org) dealing with  development of Gnus. You can read
the ding list via  NNTP, too under the name gnus.ding from
news.gnus.org.

   If you want to stay in the big8,  news.software.newssreaders is also
read by some Gnus  users (but chances for qualified help are much
better in  the above groups) and if you speak German, there's
de.comm.software.gnus.

Question 9.1:
.............

Starting Gnus is really slow, how to speed it up?

   Answer:

   The reason for this could be the way Gnus reads it's  active file,
see the node "The Active File" in the Gnus  manual for things you might
try to speed the process up.   An other idea would be to byte compile
your ~/.gnus (say  `M-x byte-compile-file RET ~/.gnus  RET' to do it).
Finally, if you have require  statements in your .gnus, you could
replace them with  eval-after-load, which loads the stuff not at startup
time, but when it's needed. Say you've got this in your  ~/.gnus:

     (require 'message)
     (add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled))

then as soon as you start Gnus, message.el is loaded. If  you replace
it with

     (eval-after-load "message"
           '(add-to-list 'message-syntax-checks '(sender . disabled)))

it's loaded when it's needed.

Question 9.2:
.............

How to speed up the process of entering a group?

   Answer:

   A speed killer is setting the variable  gnus-fetch-old-headers to
anything different from nil,  so don't do this if speed is an issue. To
speed up  building of summary say

     (gnus-compile)

at the bottom of your ~/.gnus, this will make gnus  byte-compile things
like  gnus-summary-line-format.   then you could increase the value of
gc-cons-threshold  by saying something like

     (setq gc-cons-threshold 3500000)

in ~/.emacs. If you don't care about width of CJK  characters or use
Gnus 5.10.0 or younger together with a  recent GNU Emacs, you should say

     (setq gnus-use-correct-string-widths nil)

in ~/.gnus (thanks to Jesper harder for the last  two suggestions).
Finally if you are still using 5.8.8  or 5.9 and experience speed
problems with summary  buffer generation, you definitely should update
to  5.10.0 since there quite some work on improving it has  been done.

Question 9.3:
.............

Sending mail becomes slower and slower, what's up?

   Answer:

   The reason could be that you told Gnus to archive the  messages you
wrote by setting  gnus-message-archive-group. Try to use a nnml group
instead of an archive group, this should bring you back  to normal
speed.
