;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a simple wrapper around the GNU TLS command
;; line application "gnutls-cli" to make Emacs support STARTTLS.  It
;; is backwards compatible (same API functions) with the "starttls.el"
;; that is part of Emacs 21 written by Daiki Ueno <ueno@unixuser.org>.
;; (That version used an external program "starttls" that isn't widely
;; installed, and was based on OpenSSL.)

;; This package require GNUTLS 0.9.90 (released 2003-10-08) or later.

;; Usage is similar to `open-network-stream'.  Evaluating the following:
;;
;; (progn
;;   (setq tmp (open-starttls-stream "test" (current-buffer) "mail.example.com" 143))
;;   (process-send-string tmp ". starttls\n")
;;   (sit-for 4)
;;   (message "STARTTLS output:\n%s" (negotiate-starttls tmp))
;;   (process-send-string tmp ". capability\n"))
;;
;; in, e.g., the *scratch* buffer, yields the following output:
;;
;; * OK imap.example.com Cyrus IMAP4 v2.1.15 server ready
;; . OK Begin TLS negotiation now
;; * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA ...
;; . OK Completed
;; nil
;;
;; And the message buffer contains:
;;
;; STARTTLS output:
;; *** Starting TLS handshake
;; - Server's trusted authorities:
;;    [0]: O=Sendmail,OU=Sendmail Server,CN=imap.example.com,EMAIL=admin@imap.example.com
;; - Certificate type: X.509
;;  - Got a certificate list of 1 certificates.

;;  # The hostname in the certificate matches 'imap.example.com'.
