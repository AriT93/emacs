;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements a simple wrapper around "gnutls-cli" to
;; make Emacs support TLS/SSL.
;;
;; Usage is the same as `open-network-stream', i.e.:
;;
;; (setq tmp (open-tls-stream "test" (current-buffer) "news.mozilla.org" 563))
;; ...
;; #<process test>
;; (process-send-string tmp "mode reader\n")
;; 200 secnews.netscape.com Netscape-Collabra/3.52 03615 NNRP ready ...
;; nil
;; (process-send-string tmp "quit\n")
;; 205
;; nil

;; To use this package as a replacement for ssl.el by William M. Perry
;; <wmperry@cs.indiana.edu>, you need to evaluate the following:

Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process' closes it.
Args are NAME BUFFER HOST SERVICE.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer (or buffer-name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer
Third arg is name of the host to connect to, or its IP address.
Fourth arg SERVICE is name of the service desired, or an integer
specifying a port number to connect to."
