;; Description:
;; ===========

;; Gnus-Diary is a wrapper around the NNDiary Gnus backend.  It is here to
;; make your nndiary-user life easier in different ways.  So, you don't have
;; to use it if you don't want to.  But, really, you should.

;; Gnus-Diary offers the following features on top of the NNDiary backend:

;;  - A nice summary line format:
;;    Displaying diary messages in standard summary line format (usually
;;    something like "<From Joe>: <Subject>") is pretty useless.  Most of the
;;    time, you're the one who wrote the message, and you mostly want to see
;;    the event's date.  Gnus-Diary offers you a nice summary line format
;;    which will do this.  By default, a summary line will appear like this:
;;
;;     <Event Date>: <Subject> <Remaining time>
;;
;;   for example, here's how Joe's birthday is displayed in my
;;   "nndiary:birhdays" summary buffer (the message is expirable, but will
;;   never be deleted, as it specifies a regular event):
;;
;;   E  Sat, Sep 22 01, 12:00: Joe's birthday (in 6 months, 1 week)

;;  - More article sorting functions:
;;    Gnus-Diary adds a new sorting function called
;;    `gnus-summary-sort-by-schedule'.  This function lets you organize your
;;    diary summary buffers from the closest event to the farthest one.

;;  - Automatic generation of diary group parameters:
;;    When you create a new diary group, or visit one, Gnus-Diary checks your
;;    group parameters, and if needed, sets the summary line format to the
;;    diary-specific value, adds the diary-specific sorting functions, and
;;    also adds the different `X-Diary-*' headers to the group's
;;    posting-style.  It is then easier to send a diary message, because if
;;    you use `C-u a' or `C-u m' on a diary group to prepare a message, these
;;    headers will be inserted automatically (but not filled with proper
;;    values yet).

;;  - An interactive mail-to-diary convertion function:
;;    The function `gnus-diary-check-message' ensures that the current message
;;    contains all the required diary headers, and prompts you for values /
;;    correction if needed.  This function is hooked in the nndiary backend so
;;    that moving an article to an nndiary group will trigger it
;;    automatically.  It is also bound to `C-c D c' in message-mode and
;;    article-edit-mode in order to ease the process of converting a usual
;;    mail to a diary one.  This function takes a prefix argument which will
;;    force prompting of all diary headers, regardless of their
;;    presence/validity.  That way, you can very easily reschedule a diary
;;    message for instance.


;; Usage:
;; =====

;; 0/ Don't use any `gnus-user-format-function-[d|D]'.  Gnus-Diary provides
;;    both of these (sorry if you used them before).
;; 1/ Add '(require 'gnus-diary) to your gnusrc file.
;; 2/ Customize your gnus-diary options to suit your needs.
