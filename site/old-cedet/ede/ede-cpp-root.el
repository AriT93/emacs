;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Not everyone can use automake, or an EDE project type.  For
;; pre-existing code, it is often helpful jut to be able to wrap the
;; whole thing up in as simple a way as possible.
;;
;; The cpp-root project type will allow you to create a single object
;; with no save-file in your .emacs file that will be recognized, and
;; provide a way to easilly allow EDE to provide Semantic with the
;; ability to find header files, and other various source files
;; quickly.
;;
;; The cpp-root class knows a few things about C++ projects, such as
;; the prevalence of "include" directories, and typical file-layout
;; stuff.  If this isn't sufficient, you can subclass
;; `ede-cpp-root-project' and add your own tweaks in just a few lines.
;; See the end of this file for an example.
;;
;;; EXAMPLE
;; 
;; Add this to your .emacs file, modifying apropriate bits as needed.
;;
;; (ede-cpp-root-project "SOMENAME" :file "/dir/to/some/file")
;;
;; Replace SOMENAME with whatever name you want, and the filename to
;; an actual file at the root of your project.  It might be a
;; Makefile, a README file.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  It's just
;; a key to hang the rest of EDE off of.
;;
;; The most likely reason to create this project, is to help make
;; finding files within the project faster.  In conjunction with
;; Semantic completion, having a short include path is key.  You can
;; override the include path like this:
;;
;; (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME"
;;     :include-path '( "/include" "../include" "/c/include" )
;;     :system-include-path '( "/usr/include/c++/3.2.2/" )
;;     :spp-table '( ("MOOSE" . "")
;;                   ("CONST" . "const") ) )
;;
;;  In this case each item in the include path list is searched.  If
;;  the directory starts with "/", then that expands to the project
;;  root directory.  If a directory does not start with "/", then it
;;  is relative to the default-directory of the current buffer when
;;  the file name is expanded.
;;
;;  The include path only affects C/C++ header files.  Use the slot
;;  :header-match-regexp to change it.
;;
;;  The :system-include-path allows you to specify full directory
;;  names to include directories where system header files can be
;;  found.  These will be applied to files in this project only.
;;
;;  The :spp-table provides a list of project specific #define style
;;  macros that are unique to this project, passed in to the compiler
;;  on the command line, or are in special headers.
;;
;; If you want to override the file-finding tool with your own
;; function you can do this:
;;
;; (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file "FILENAME" :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
;;
;; Where MYFCN is a symbol for a function.  See:
;;
;; M-x describe-class RET ede-cpp-root-project RET
;;
;; for documentation about the locate-fcn extension.
;;
;;; ADVANCED EXAMPLE
;;
;; If the cpp-root project style is right for you, but you want a
;; dynamic loader, instead of hard-coding values in your .emacs, you
;; can do that too, but you will need to write some lisp code.
;;
;; To do that, you need to add an entry to the
;; `ede-project-class-files' list, and also provide two functions to
;; teach EDE how to load your project pattern
;;
;; It would oook like this:
;;
;; (defun MY-FILE-FOR-DIR (&optional dir)
;;   "Return a full file name to the project file stored in DIR."
;;   <write your code here, or return nil>
;;   )
;;
;; (defun MY-ROOT-FCN ()
;;   "Return the root directory for `default-directory'"
;;   ;; You might be able to use `ede-cpp-root-project-root'.
;;   )
;; 
;; (defun MY-LOAD (dir)
;;   "Load a project of type `cpp-root' for the directory DIR.
;; Return nil if there isn't one."
;;   (ede-cpp-root-project "NAME" :file (expand-file-name "FILE" dir)
;;                                :locate-fcn 'MYFCN)
;;   )
;;
;; (add-to-list 'ede-project-class-files
;; 	     (ede-project-autoload "cpp-root"
;; 	      :name "CPP ROOT"
;; 	      :file 'ede-cpp-root
;; 	      :proj-file 'MY-FILE-FOR-DIR
;;            :proj-root 'MY-ROOT-FCN
